Take a bag. Come on, take a bag. I took a bag home last night, and it cost me a lot more than £10, I can tell you. Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand stolen in Stepney. It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else. Don't think 'cause these boxes are sealed up they're empty. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker. And by the look of some of you lot here today, I'd make more money with me measuring tape. Here, one price. - £10. - Did you say £10?

      "[('There he is! Let\\'s get him. Come on. Verifying materialization sequence. Bring up resolution on radar unit 12. - Area 7 to Command. - Go ahead. We could use another survey team out here, sir. Base to Ensign McCauley and Ensign Gilles. Please report to Area 7 and assist the edaphology team. Acknowledged. Transferring anthropometric data files to secondary processor. - Ethnographic studies indicate 97%... - The ecological analysis... Still working on correlating that unidentified... The comparative linguistic analysis is complete, sir. Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this. Transmit it to the ship. Alert! Area 12! - The android, he\\'s out of control. - Report. He\\'s headed toward the village. We\\'re trying to stop him. Over there! Magnify. Hold your fire. What is it? What\\'s happening? Base to Commander Data. Rerouting micro-hydraulic power distribution. - Regulating thermal overload. - Data, report to Base immediately! Transferring positronic matrix functions. Engaging secondary protocol. He\\'s trying to remove the headpiece. All field units, intercept the android. Artim, Artim, it\\'s all right. Get inside. Now. Find shelter. Everyone, get inside. Now. Back to your homes! Move it! Now! Move! Secondary protocol is active. - They can see him. - Stop him! Now! Commander Data, stand down. That\\'s an order! I repeat, stand down! Who are they? It\\'s an M-Class planet. Population, 300 million. - Say the greeting again. - Yew-cheen chef-faw. Emphasis on the \"cheen\" and the \"faw.\" You either need a new uniform or a new neck. My collar size is exactly as it was at the Academy. Of course it is. Our guests have arrived. They are eating the floral arrangements on the banquet tables. I guess they don\\'t believe in cocktails before dinner. Oh, my God! Are they vegetarian? That\\'s not in there. Perhaps we should have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette, something that goes well with chrysanthemums. - Bridge to Captain Picard. - Go ahead, Ensign. Command wants to know our ETA at the Goren system. The Goren system? They need us to mediate some territorial dispute. No, no. We can\\'t delay the archeological expedition to Hanoran II. That\\'ll put us right in the middle of the monsoon season. - Captain. - Thank you. The diplomatic corps is busy with Dominion negotiations. Yes. So they need us to put out one more brush fire. Can anyone remember when we used to be explorers? - Deck 10. - Yew-cheen chef-faw. Remember, they have a significantly less advanced technology than ours. They only achieved warp drive last year. And the Federation Council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly. In view of our losses to the Borg and the Dominion, the Council feels we need all the allies we can get these days. Captain on deck. You\\'ll be expected to dance with the Regent Cuzar. - Can she mambo? - Very funny. The Captain used to cut quite a rug. La Forge to Picard. Captain, I need to talk to you before the reception. - Captain. Doctor. - Mr. Worf! - Worf. - What the hell are you doing here? - I was at the Manzar colony... - He\\'s a little late, Geordi. - Can it wait? - I don\\'t think so. Excuse me. Tell him that I\\'m already here, and I\\'ll talk to him when he arrives. Mr. Worf, I have... Geordi, the Captain would like you to come up here. Tell him we\\'ve received a communiqué from Admiral Dougherty. It\\'s about Data. Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people? We are so honored to be accepted within the great Federation family. - We have a dance later, I believe. - I look forward to it. - Counselor. - Nice bead work. Captain. Excuse me. Captain. Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard a Son\\'a ship in Sector 441. - He\\'s requesting Data\\'s schematics. - Is something wrong? The message doesn\\'t say. Data should have been back by now. They were only scheduled to observe the Ba\\'ku village for one week. Geordi, would you set up a secure comm link - with the Admiral in the anteroom? - Aye, sir. Captain, Hars Adislo. We met at the Nel Bato Conference last year. Did you ever have a chance to read my paper on thermionic transconductance? Would you excuse me? He\\'s not acknowledging any Starfleet protocols, not responding to any of our hails. Have you any idea what precipitated this behavior? None. Now he\\'s holding our people hostage down there. Well, the Enterprise could be at your position in two days, Admiral. That\\'s probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn\\'t been fitted for this region. There are environmental concerns. What kind of concerns? We haven\\'t fully identified the anomalies yet. They\\'re calling this whole area the Briar Patch. Took us a day to reach a location where we could even get a signal to you. Just get me Data\\'s schematics. I\\'ll keep you informed. Dougherty out. - His emotion chip? - He didn\\'t take it with him. - Send the Admiral Data\\'s schematics. - Aye, sir. - Yes, sir? - Ensign, would you report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course? Aye, sir. I would like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows. I\\'m going to ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so that he can join us. We\\'re gonna stop by Sector 441 on our way to the Goren system. - They are in opposite directions, sir. - Are they? I never should have let you talk me into that duck blind in the first place. Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be. Our procedures were in place to protect the planet\\'s population from unnecessary risk. Planet\\'s population, 600 people. If you want to avoid unnecessary risks, next time, leave your android at home. Bridge to Ahdar Ru\\'afo. We are approaching the planet. Take us into a high orbit. Lie down, Admiral. The girls\\'ll take 20 years off your face. - Another time, perhaps. - Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer. I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation. - Report. - Phaser blast. Unknown origin. Raise shields. - Take us out of orbit. - Photon torpedoes. Brace for impact. - The vessel has broken off pursuit, sir. - Visual contact. That\\'s our ship. Captain, we\\'re about to lose all communications with Starfleet. Do you have everything you need from Command? I\\'ve downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission - and the Son\\'a. - You have two days to become experts. Mr. Worf, our job is to come up with a plan to safely capture Data. I\\'ve already had Commander La Forge modify this tricorder with one of Data\\'s actuation servos. Its operational range is only 4 meters, but it will shut him down. Good to have you back, Mr. Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in. Half a century ago, they conquered two primitive races, the Tarlac and the Ellora, and then integrated them into their culture as a labor class. Look at this. The Son\\'a are known to have produced mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white. Their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the Second Khitomer Accord. Why would we be involved with these people? Good question. - You haven\\'t done that in a long time. - What? - What you\\'re doing to my neck. - Was I doing something to your neck? Bridge to Commander Worf. - Worf! - Captain. I don\\'t know how they do it on Deep Space Nine, but on the Enterprise, we still report for duty on time. - Sorry, sir. I\\'m on my way. - We\\'ll skip the court-martial this time. Picard out. When was the last time we aligned the torque sensors? - Two months ago, sir. - They don\\'t sound right. The torque sensors are out of alignment by 12 microns. You could hear that? When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron misalignment. Excuse me, sir. The Son\\'a ship with Admiral Dougherty aboard has entered tracking range. Straighten your baldric, Commander. On screen. Captain, I wasn\\'t expecting you. This is too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral. I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in a mission scout ship yesterday. Ru\\'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team. Commander Worf and I are working on several tactical plans to see... Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain. Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed. I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc, but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet. If our first attempt to capture Data fails, I will terminate him. I should be the one to do it. I\\'m his captain and his friend. All right, you have 12 hours, Captain. Then I want you out of the Briar Patch. In the meantime, we\\'ll head out to the perimeter to call for Son\\'a reinforcements in case you fail. - Understood. - Good luck, Captain. Dougherty out. Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface. Transmit a wideband covariant signal. That ought to get his attention. He must be using the planet\\'s rings to mask his approach. The metaphasic radiation from the rings is in a state of extreme flux. We\\'ll steer clear of those. Come out, come out, wherever you are Sir? That\\'s something that my mother... Hold on. Open all hailing frequencies. Data, this is Captain Picard. Data, please respond. If we fire tachyon bursts, it might force him to reset his shield harmonics. - When he does, we can beam him out. - Make it so. Direct hit. He\\'s resetting his shield harmonics. Beam him out. - He has activated a transport inhibitor. - Prepare to enter the atmosphere. We\\'ll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him. Scanners are off-line. Evasive maneuvers, heading 1-4-0 mark 3-1. He can fly a ship. He can anticipate tactical strategies. Clearly his brain is functioning. We\\'ve seen how he responds to threats. I wonder how he would respond... Mr. Worf, do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? No, sir, I have not had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I have been back. They\\'re composers, Worf, from the 19th century. Data was rehearsing a production of H.M.S. Pinafore just before he left. A British tar is a soaring soul As free as a mountain bird His energetic fist should be ready to resist A dictatorial word Sing, Worf, sing. His nose should pant And his lip should curl His cheeks should flame And his brow should furl His bosom should heave And his heart should glow And his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow His nose should pant And his lip should curl His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl His bosom should heave and his heart should glow And his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow Prepare the docking clamps. His eyes should flash with an inborn fire His brow with scorn be wrung He never should bow down to a domineering frown - Or the tang of a tyrant tongue - Or the tang of a tyrant tongue His heart should stamp And his throat should growl His hair should curl And his face should scowl His eyes should flash And his breast protrude And this should be his customary attitude His foot should stamp And his throat should growl His hair should curl and his face... Inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance. If we do not release him, he may destroy both vessels. I\\'m not letting go of him. - We must stabilize the damping field. - Reroute emergency power to inertial dampers. The auto-sequencer was damaged by phaser fire. Transferring controls to manual. Power sequence realigned. Engaging stabilizers. - Damping field established. - Maximum power. Now, Mr. Worf. Captain, Commander Data is safely in custody. Captain, Subahdar Gallatin, Son\\'a Command. Lieutenant Curtis, attaché to Admiral Dougherty. - Are you all right? - We\\'ve been treated extremely well. They have incredible mental discipline, clarity of perception. - My name is Sojef. - Jean-Luc Picard. These are my officers, Dr. Crusher, Counselor Troi. - Would you like something to eat? - No, we\\'re here to rescue them. As you wish, but I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life. Prepare the hostages for transport to the ship. They should be quarantined before joining the ship\\'s population. We were under the impression they were being held against their will. It\\'s not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will. The artificial life-form would not allow them to leave. In fact, he told us they were our enemies and that more would follow. - Are you our enemy? - Anij. My people have a strict policy of non-interference in other cultures. It\\'s our Prime Directive. Your directive apparently doesn\\'t include spying on other cultures. The artificial life-form is a member of my crew. Apparently, he was taken ill. There was a phase variance in his positronic matrix which we were unable to repair. I think the Captain finds it hard to believe that we\\'d have any skills repairing a positronic device. Our technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives. We believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man. But at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do. - You have warp capability? - Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us except away from here? I apologize for our intrusion. And because they have warp capability, the consequences to their society will be minimal. You\\'ve done a terrific job, Jean-Luc. Now pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How\\'s Data? In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic. I\\'ll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We\\'re heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us, so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out. You\\'re not finished here? Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out. Come in. - Hi. - You got a minute? Sure. I need a little counseling. Well, there\\'s a first time for everything. So, do I lie down or what? Well, whatever makes you comfortable, but this isn\\'t one of the usual therapeutic postures. - But it is comfortable. - Why don\\'t you try sitting up? Why don\\'t you try lying down? Well, you\\'re in quite a mood today. Do you really need counseling or did you come down here to play? - I think I\\'m having a midlife crisis. - I believe you. I\\'m not sleeping well. Dr. Crusher has something that can take care of that. What I need, I can\\'t get from Dr. Crusher. Counselor, do you think it\\'s possible for two people to go back in time, fix a mistake they\\'ve made? On this ship, anything\\'s possible. - Yuck! - Yuck? - I never kissed you with a beard before. - I kiss you and you say \"yuck\"? I had to reconstruct Data\\'s neural net and replace these. They contain memory engrams. - How were they damaged? - By a Son\\'a weapon. There\\'s no doubt about it, Captain. That\\'s what caused Data to malfunction. But the Son\\'a report claims that they didn\\'t fire until after he malfunctioned. Well, I don\\'t believe it happened that way. Why would they fire on him without provocation? All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then his fail-safe system was activated. Fail-safe? His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions. But you\\'re saying that he still knew the difference between right and wrong. In a sense, that\\'s all he knew. The system is designed to protect Data against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss. And yet he attacked us, and he told the Ba\\'ku that we were a threat. - Are the implants bothering you? - I\\'m all right. I think I\\'m just tired. - Geordi? Captain? - You\\'re on the Enterprise, Data. I seem to be missing several memory engrams. There they are. Data, what\\'s the last thing that you remember? His nose should pant and his lips should curl From the mission. I was in an isolation suit gathering physiometric data on the Ba\\'ku. My last memory is going into the hills following some children. Artim, do you remember where you were on the day of lightning when the artificial life-form appeared to us? - In the hills by the dam. - Can you show us? There is no reason to fear me. I am now operating within normal parameters. - What? - They fixed me. - Captain, the boy is afraid of me. - It\\'s nothing personal, Data. You have to remember, these people have rejected technology. I am the personification of everything they have rejected. Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks. Bridge to Riker. Can I get back to you, Mr. Worf? Admiral Dougherty is on the comm link, sir. Patch him through. Yes, Admiral? Why haven\\'t you left orbit? Captain Picard is still on the surface, sir. Doing what? He didn\\'t want to leave until we could adequately explain why Data malfunctioned. His future in Starfleet could depend on it. Remind the Captain his 12 hours are up. - Yes, sir. - Dougherty out. Your body is producing far too many toxins. We\\'ve reached the limit of genetic manipulation. I won\\'t need anymore genetic manipulation if our Federation friends will allow us to complete this mission. Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills. How about a passive radiation scan? Curious. There appear to be strong neutrino emissions coming from the lake. - Can he breathe underwater? - Data doesn\\'t breathe. - Won\\'t he rust? - No. Captain! Captain! I believe I know what is causing the neutrino emissions. The vessel is clearly Federation in origin, Captain. \"Just a few loose ends to tie up.\" - We\\'re not interested in such things. - I am. - I think it would be wiser if you didn\\'t... - I\\'m going with you. It is a holographic projection. Incomplete, I might add. What you\\'re seeing is a computer-driven image created by photons and force fields. I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is, why would anyone want to create one of our village? Data, if you were following the children and discovered this ship... It is conceivable, I was shot to protect the secret of its existence. Why would they duplicate this village except to deceive the Ba\\'ku? - Deceive us? - To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in the village, wake up the next morning on this flying holodeck, transported en masse. Within a few days, they\\'re relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it. Why would the Federation or the Son\\'a wish to move the Ba\\'ku? I don\\'t know. Computer, end program. Decloak the vessel. Help! I can\\'t swim! Don\\'t panic. I\\'ve been shot at, thrown into the lake out of a ship that\\'s come to abduct us. What\\'s there to panic about? In the event of a water landing, I have been designed to serve as a floatation device. Mr. Worf, did the hostages mention anything about a cloaked ship during their debriefing? - No, sir. - Debrief them again. - Have you been in a fight, Mr. Worf? - No, sir. It is a gorch. A gorch? A pimple, sir. Well, it\\'s hardly noticeable. Smooth as an android\\'s bottom, eh, Data? I beg your pardon, sir? Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven\\'t left yet. We\\'re not going anywhere. Deck 5. You Klingons never do anything small, do you? Dr. Crusher asked to speak to you when you returned. - Picard to Crusher. - Captain. The Son\\'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters. - And our people? - They\\'re fine. In fact, they\\'re better than fine. Increased metabolism, improved muscle tone, high energy. We should all be so lucky. Very well, Doctor. Picard out. Worf, don\\'t release the Son\\'a officers till I\\'ve talked to Ahdar Ru\\'afo. Aye, sir. Commander, may I... Computer, music. - No. Not that, something Latin. - Specify. The mambo. That\\'s more like it. How old are you? We came here from a solar system on the verge of self-annihilation, where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home, a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was 309 years ago. And you haven\\'t aged a day since then. Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived, in terms of my physical condition. There\\'s an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet\\'s rings. It continuously regenerates our genetic structure. - You must\\'ve noticed the effects by now. - We\\'ve just begun to. - I suppose you\\'re 75. - No, I\\'m 12. The metaphasic radiation won\\'t begin to affect him until he reaches maturity. To most off-landers, what you have here is more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. I\\'m afraid that\\'s the reason that someone may be trying to take your world away from you. The artificial life-form was right. If it were not for Data, it\\'s probable that you would be relocated by now. How can we possibly defend ourselves? The moment we pick up a weapon, we become one of them. - We lose everything we are. - It may not come to that. Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy want to keep it a secret, not only from you, but from my people, as well. I don\\'t intend to let them. We\\'ve always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn\\'t been easy. Many of the young people want to know more about the offland. They\\'re attracted to stories of a faster pace of life. Most of my people who live that fast a life would sell their souls to slow it down. But not you? There are days. You don\\'t live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard. Well, in defense of offlanders, there are many more people like me. Who wouldn\\'t be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don\\'t think so. You give me more credit than I deserve. Well, of course I\\'m tempted. Who wouldn\\'t be? But some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a large one. I\\'d hoped that we had learned from our mistakes but it seems that some of us haven\\'t. This is extraordinary craftsmanship. It\\'s the work of students. They\\'re almost ready to become apprentices. In 30 or 40 years, some of them will take their place among the artisans. Apprenticing for 30 years. Did your people\\'s mental discipline develop here? More questions. Always the explorer. - If you stay long enough, that\\'ll change. - Will it? You stop reviewing what happened yesterday, stop planning for tomorrow. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time? A perfect moment? When time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment? Seeing my home planet from space for the first time. Yes, exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception. You explore the universe. We\\'ve discovered that a single moment in time can be a universe in itself, full of powerful forces. Most people aren\\'t aware enough of the now to even notice. I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn. It took us centuries to learn that it doesn\\'t have to take centuries to learn. There\\'s one thing I don\\'t understand. In 300 years, you never learned to swim? I just haven\\'t got around to it yet. I wonder if you\\'re aware of the trust you engender, Jean-Luc Picard. - In my experience, it\\'s unusual for... - For an offlander? For someone so young. - Geordi? - Captain. As it turns out, there wasn\\'t anything wrong with my implants at all. There was something right with my eyes. When Dr. Crusher removed the ocular connection, she found that the cells around my optic nerve had... Started to regenerate. It may not last, and if it doesn\\'t, I just... I just wanted, before we go... You know, I\\'ve never seen a sunrise, at least, not the way you see them. Come. Am I to understand that you\\'re not releasing my men, Captain? We found the holoship. Ru\\'afo, why don\\'t you let the Captain and me... No! This entire mission has been one Federation blunder after another. You will return my men or this alliance will end with the destruction of your ship. You\\'re looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested. I won\\'t let you move them, Admiral. I will take this to the Federation Council. I\\'m acting on orders from the Federation Council. How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive? The Prime Directive doesn\\'t apply. These people are not indigenous to this planet. They were never meant to be immortal. We\\'ll simply be restoring them to their natural evolution. Who the hell are we to determine the next course of evolution for this people? Jean-Luc, there are 600 people down there. We\\'ll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions. The Son\\'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles from the planet\\'s rings. - A planet in Federation space. - That\\'s right. We have the planet. They have the technology, a technology we can\\'t duplicate. You know what that makes us? Partners. Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs. On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son\\'a. I\\'m not worried about that. Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago. With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled. An entire new medical science will evolve. I understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life. Will you take that away from him? There are metaphasic particles all over the Briar Patch. Why does it have to be this one planet? It\\'s the concentration in the rings that makes the whole damn thing work. Don\\'t ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. When it\\'s over, the planet will be uninhabitable for generations. Admiral, delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology. Our best scientific minds already have. We can\\'t find any other way to do this. Then the Son\\'a can establish a separate colony on the planet until we do. It would take 10 years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won\\'t survive that long. Besides, they don\\'t want to live in the middle of the Briar Patch. - Who would? - The Ba\\'ku. We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded. It\\'s an attack upon its very soul. And it will destroy the Ba\\'ku, just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history. Jean-Luc, we\\'re only moving 600 people. How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand? A million? How many people does it take, Admiral? I\\'m ordering you to the Goren system. I\\'m also ordering the release of the Son\\'a officers. File whatever protests you wish to, Captain. By the time you do, this will all be done. Gallatin. So, the righteous Starfleet captain finally released you. Yes. Did you encounter any problems on the surface? No, sir. But it wasn\\'t easy being among them. I\\'m sure. Just don\\'t forget what they did to us. We\\'ll have them rounded up in a day or two. We needn\\'t bother with a Federation holoship anymore. - Just get the holding cells ready. - Yes, sir. I\\'m going to miss these little flesh-stretching sessions of ours, my dear. Re-routing the transport grid to avoid detection was wise, sir. However, the transporter is rarely used after 0200 hours. Taking the Captain\\'s yacht out for a spin? Seven metric tons of ultritium explosives, eight tetryon pulse launchers and 10 isomagnetic disintegrators. Looks like you\\'re planning on doing some hunting. Return to your quarters. - That\\'s an order. - No uniform, no orders. Captain, how could I look at another sunrise knowing what my sight cost these people? I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth, which could affect everyone\\'s judgment. Except mine, of course. Okay, Data, what do you think we should do? Saddle up. Lock and load. They won\\'t begin the procedure while the planet is still inhabited, so our job is to keep the planet inhabited. Will, Geordi, go back and put a face on what\\'s happening here. Make the Council see the Ba\\'ku. It\\'s too easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of a people you don\\'t know. - I\\'ll be back before you know it. - We\\'ll hold out as long as we can. The injector performs perfectly in every simulation. Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface. What? Appeared to be the Captain\\'s yacht. Five persons onboard. We\\'re not waiting until morning. Take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight. Gallatin. If Picard or any of his people interfere, eliminate them. We\\'re leaving the village! Take only what you need! Bring food! We may not be back for days! It is a transport inhibitor. It will help prevent spaceships from beaming anyone off the surface. These veins of kelbonite running through the hills will interfere with their transporters, and when the terrain forces us away from the deposits, then we\\'ll use transport inhibitors as a compensation. The mountains have the heaviest concentration of kelbonite. Once there, it\\'ll make transport virtually impossible. There are caves in those mountains. Then we should be able to hold out for a long time once we\\'re there, but they\\'re not gonna make it easy for us to get there. Captain! We\\'ve activated the transport inhibitors around the village. Good. Let\\'s move these people out! Transporters are not functioning. They\\'re blocking the beams with some kind of inhibitors. We\\'ll have to locate and destroy them. No, no. Son, you\\'re carrying too much. We have a long climb ahead of us. We\\'ve lost three transport inhibitors. There\\'s a gap in the field. Artim! Father! They\\'re following the kelbonite deposits, using the interference to block our transporters. - Recommendations? - Take me down. Let me talk to Picard. Talk! We should send down an assault team and take them by force. That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation... Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules. Look in the mirror, Admiral. The Federation is old. In the past 24 months, they\\'ve been challenged by every major power in the quadrant. The Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion, they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That\\'s why you\\'ve embraced our offer, because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain\\'s valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba\\'ku, your Federation politicians will waver. Your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate. Your Federation allies will want their say. Need I go on? There\\'s an alternative to an all-out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock onto them. We\\'d have to tag every one of them. That would take time, and we don\\'t have it. The Enterprise is only 19 hours from communications range with the Federation. - I\\'ll order Riker to turn around. - Picard\\'s first officer. You really believe he\\'ll listen? My ships are capable of intercepting the Enterprise before it reaches the perimeter. I could send them to... To escort it back. But Commander Riker might not want to come. Send your ships. - Do you like being a machine? - I aspire to be more than I am. I know why. So people like us won\\'t be afraid of you anymore. Perhaps. Don\\'t you ever get tired? My power cells continually recharge themselves. I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like to be a machine. Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it is like to be a child. - Really? - Really. For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else\\'s. But they are in a constant state of growth. - Do you find it difficult to adapt? - Adapt? A child\\'s specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. It is a wonder you do not trip over your own feet. Sometimes I do. My legs are exactly 87.2 centimeters in length. They were 87.2 centimeters the day I was created. They will be 87.2 centimeters the day I go off-line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I will never know the experience of growing up or tripping over my own feet. But you\\'ve never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don\\'t like. I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child. - Do machines ever play? - Yes. I play the violin, and my chess routines are quite advanced. No, I mean, haven\\'t you ever just played for fun? Androids do not have fun. Look, if you wanna know what it\\'s like to be a child, you need to learn to play. Captain. Mr. Worf, you need a haircut. Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during jak\\'tahla. - Jak\\'tahla? - Roughly translated, puberty, although for a Klingon, that scarcely does it justice. Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies, - you let me know at once. - Yes, sir. The Ba\\'ku need some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this is the safest area within the next few kilometers. Very well. We\\'ll take an hour. - Have them break out some rations. - Aye, sir. Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin. We can hide there for days. By now, the Son\\'a will have scanned this area. They\\'ll know that as well as we do. It\\'s been 300 years since I\\'ve seen a bald man. How is it that you never married? And don\\'t tell me it\\'s just because you haven\\'t got around to it yet. - What\\'s the rush? - I should warn you, I\\'ve always been attracted to older women. - How are you doing this? - No more questions. Commander, I\\'m showing two Son\\'a ships on an intercept course. - How long till they reach us? - Eighteen minutes. We won\\'t be able to get a transmission out of here for at least another hour. They\\'re hailing us. Tell them our transceiver assembly is down, that we can send messages but not receive them. - I don\\'t think they believe us. - Why not? Photon torpedo. Isn\\'t that the universal greeting when communications are down? I think it\\'s the universal greeting when you don\\'t like someone. Full impulse. Manifolds can\\'t handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander. If we don\\'t outrun them, the manifolds\\'ll be the only thing left on the ship. - I\\'ll be in Engineering. - Red alert! All hands, battle stations! And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? Not that we care about such things in this day and age. Thank you, Data. I\\'ve an odd craving for the blood of a live Kolar beast. This environment must be affecting me again. And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? Not that we care about... Take cover! Isolinear tags. The transporters can lock onto them. We have to find shelter. There\\'s a cavern at the base of the next hill. This way! - Shields at 60%. - Engineering to Bridge. We\\'re burning deuterium down here. We\\'re gonna blow ourselves up. We won\\'t need any help from the Son\\'a! What\\'s inside that nebula cluster? Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas. We don\\'t want to go in there, sir. Yes, we do. I\\'ll take it from here, Ensign. Time to use the Briar Patch the way Brer Rabbit did. Inside the caves, quickly! Everyone! This way! Inside. Definitely feeling aggressive tendencies, sir. They\\'ve detonated an isolytic burst. A subspace tear is forming. On screen. I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord. Remind me to lodge a protest. Our warp core is acting like a magnet to the tear. We\\'re pulling it like a zipper across space. Options? - We could eject the core. - Will that stop the tear? You got me, Commander. That\\'s your expert opinion? Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade. Then again, it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That\\'s why they were banned. The tear is closing on us. - Impact in 15 seconds. - Eject the core. I just did. Impact in 10 seconds. Detonate! Get me a medic over here! It worked, Commander. The tear has been sealed. Yeah, but there\\'s nothing to stop them from doing it again, and we\\'re fresh out of warp cores. We\\'re still 36 minutes from transmission range, sir. We\\'re through running from these bastards. Another 43 reported taken, sir. Captain, they\\'re trying to drive us out so their drones can tag us. With all the hydrothermal vents in the substrata, the structural integrity of this cavern is not going to hold for long. - Is there another way out of here? - I don\\'t know. Captain, tracking the water\\'s course may reveal another exit. Mr. Worf, come with us. I\\'m reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow behind that calcite formation, Captain. Will this structure hold if we were to blast through? I believe it is safe, sir. Fire. Get everybody into those caves, and set up force fields once they\\'re inside. Aye, sir. Geordi, are those pockets of metreon gas? Yes, Commander. Highly volatile. I\\'d recommend we keep our distance. Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can. The purpose being? The purpose being, I intend to shove it down the Son\\'a\\'s throat. Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas... It\\'s our only way out of here, Mr. Daniels. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver. If it works. Computer, access manual steering column. Transfer helm controls to manual. Bridge, storage cells are at maximum capacity. They\\'re powering their forward weapons array, sir. Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by. Full thrusters. Ramscoop released. Captain. Data, Troi, keep these people moving. Bring them out. I suspect it won\\'t be long before the drones get here. Keep moving! Keep moving! They found caves on higher ground. We\\'ll be safe there. Captain, take a look at this med-scan, his DNA profile. - How can that be possible? - Maybe we should ask them. Artim, what are you doing? Come. - Is this the last group? - Yes, sir. Get them ready to move out. We need to hurry. Anij went to find Artim. - Go with Tournel! - No, I wanna stay with you! It is safer there. Go! Worf to Picard! Two life-signs, one of them extremely faint. There are almost 4 metric tons of rock blocking our way. No. That might cause another cave-in. Anij? Anij? - Worf to Picard. - Yes? Yes, I can hear you. We are trying to get to you, sir. Anij. Help is on the way. - Worf, hurry. Anij is hurt. - How bad is she, Captain? - I\\'m losing her. - We\\'re coming as fast as we can. Anij, stay with me. Help me find the power to keep you in this moment. Stay with me. Don\\'t let go of this moment. She\\'s stabilizing. - Is it safe to move her? - Safer than leaving her here. And you thought it would take centuries to learn. Order them to surrender and I promise you won\\'t be court-martialed. If a court-martial is the only way to let the people of the Federation know what is happening here, I welcome it. The Enterprise has destroyed one of my ships! The other is on fire, requesting assistance. The Enterprise would only fire to defend itself. Ru\\'afo must have ordered the attack. I can\\'t believe he would have given that order without your consent, Admiral. I wonder which of us will be facing that court-martial. There\\'s nothing further to be gained from this. You\\'re right. This is going to end now. The Ba\\'ku want to stay on the planet. Let them. - I\\'m going to launch the injector. - You\\'re not going to launch anything... In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying. You would kill your own people, Ru\\'afo? Your own parents, brothers, sisters? Didn\\'t you know, Admiral? The Son\\'a and the Ba\\'ku are the same race. Picard just told us. Our DNA is identical. Which one were you? Gal\\'na? Ro\\'tin? Those names, those children are gone forever. What\\'s he talking about? A century ago, a group of our young people wanted to follow the ways of the offlanders. They tried to take over the colony, and when they failed... When we failed, you exiled us to die slowly. You\\'re Ro\\'tin, aren\\'t you? There\\'s something in the voice. Would you be his friend, Gal\\'na? I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you. You\\'ve brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled, except that Ru\\'afo\\'s need for revenge has now escalated into parricide. It was for the Federation. It was all for the Federation. We\\'re taking this ship out of here. This mission is over. - It is not over. - It is over! I do not take orders from you! If you launch the injector while the planet\\'s still populated, the Federation will pursue you until... The Federation will never know what happened here. Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for dinner. Deploy the collector. - Do you have a problem with that order? - May I talk to you alone? - Deploy the collector. - Yes, sir. Moving them is one thing. Killing them all... No one hated them more than you, Gal\\'na. We\\'ve come a long way together. This is the moment we\\'ve planned for so many years. Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold. See that Picard joins them. The shields in that section won\\'t protect them against the thermolytic reaction. Thank you for reminding me. Jean-Luc. Come with me. It must have been strange for you when you were a hostage, surrounded by all the friends and family you knew all those years ago, each one looking exactly as they did then. Like looking through the eyes of childhood again. And here you are, closing those eyes, trying not to see what bitterness has done to the Son\\'a, how it\\'s turned Ru\\'afo into a madman. And you, turned you into a coward, a man who denies his own conscience. Get in. A coward without the moral courage to prevent an atrocity. You offend me! Is this how a Federation officer pleads for his life? I\\'m not pleading for my life. I\\'m pleading for yours. You can still go home, Gal\\'na. Computer, close turbolift doors. What you\\'re asking me to do is impossible. Do you know how to disable the injector? I would need to be on the Bridge. The crew is loyal to Ru\\'afo. An assault would fail. Perhaps we can lure him away. It doesn\\'t matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something\\'s happening, he\\'ll override my commands with one word to his comm link. If he doesn\\'t realize something\\'s happening... Can you get me to a transmitter? I need to speak with Data and Worf down on the planet. We\\'ll need their help. Deck 12. Initiate separation protocols. Activating injector assembly. Separation in three minutes. A small craft is coming up from the surface. It\\'s powering up its weapons. - On screen. - One person aboard. It\\'s the android. He\\'s no threat. - Data to Picard. - Go ahead, Data. Captain, they\\'re ignoring my attack. Keep firing tachyon bursts into the shield grid. - Is Worf in position? - Yes, sir. He is ready for simultaneous transport. We\\'re approaching the Bridge. Picard out. Separation in one minute. Sir, the Federation ship is creating a disruption in our shield. If they go out of phase, it\\'ll increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction. Very well. Destroy that ship. Reset our shield harmonics. Do not delay the countdown. Data to Picard. They are rotating their shield harmonics. I am attempting to return to the surface, sir. The Federation ship has been disabled. Separation in 20 seconds. - What is that? - I don\\'t know. - The systems don\\'t seem affected. - Separation in 10 seconds. Five seconds. Injector assembly has separated. Exactly as the simulations predicted. I\\'m not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels. Your scanners must be malfunctioning. All ship functions are off-line. How can there be no ship functions if the viewscreen is working? Artificial gravity is stable. Life support is... A holodeck. We were transported to the holoship when we reset our shields. Everything we saw was an illusion. Ru\\'afo, authorization Delta 2-1. Override all interlinked commands to injector assembly one. Unable to comply. Injector assembly one has been deactivated. All injector subsystems aboard the collector are confirmed off-line. Decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam. Aye, sir. The crew knows something\\'s happened. I\\'ve secured the Bridge. This ship is equipped with 14 long-range transporters. Are they all useless? They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here. Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor. Sir, there\\'s nothing we can do. They already have control of our ship. I don\\'t plan on going back to our ship. - Mr. Worf, destroy that thing. - Aye, sir. Weapons systems have been taken off-line. The crew is re-routing Bridge controls. Captain, there is a problem aboard the collector. The launch sequence has resumed. Collector shields have been raised. Someone\\'s onboard. It\\'s Ru\\'afo. Can you override the launch sequence from here? Not without his access codes. Is there a self-destruct? Yes, but without the codes, it would have to be activated at the upper control matrix on the collector. Mr. Worf, try and find some way to beam through those shields. You\\'d have to detonate it manually. There\\'d only be a two-second delay. We may be able to transport between the shield generators if we are within 100 meters. Take us into position. Remain at your post, Commander. I\\'ll need you to beam me back. We\\'re approaching the collector. One minute before separation, you\\'ll see the cryogenic tanks venting. Weapons fire could ignite the exhaust. Separation in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Captain! Worf? I\\'m picking up Captain Picard\\'s bio-signature onboard the collector. - Enterprise to Picard! - Number One. We\\'re approaching your position. Do you need assistance? I may need a lift in a minute or so. We\\'re on our way. Separation in one minute. - Report. - It\\'s Ru\\'afo\\'s ship! On screen. Sensors are reading over 100 Ba\\'ku onboard and one Klingon. Target their ventral engines and life support. Set a collision course. Stop! Ru\\'afo, we\\'re getting too old for this. After today, that won\\'t be a problem for either of us. Separation in 30 seconds. You\\'re really going to risk igniting the exhaust? All right, I will! - Shields at 60%. - Hold your course. - He wouldn\\'t. - Yes, he would. Now! Stand by, Captain. We\\'re right around the corner. Sorry, time\\'s up. What kept you, Number One? The Federation Council has asked me to inform you that the Ba\\'ku relocation will be halted while they conduct a top-level review. Sir, Ru\\'afo\\'s ship is hailing us. - On screen. - On screen. Captain, the Son\\'a crew would like to negotiate a cease-fire. It may have something to do with the fact that we have three minutes of air left. We have plenty over here, Mr. Worf. Prepare to beam aboard. You think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation, it\\'ll change the way we feel? Your feelings about her have not changed since the day I met you, Commander. This place just let them out for a little fresh air. I wish there were a way to bring them back home. Ask them. I\\'m afraid there\\'s too much bitterness on both sides. Mother and son. You arranged this? I thought it might begin the healing process. What am I going to do without you? I wish I could stay, but these are perilous times for the Federation. I can\\'t abandon it to people who would threaten everything that I\\'ve spent a lifetime defending. I have to go back, if only to slow things down at the Federation Council. But I have 318 days of shore leave coming and I intend to use them. Data? It\\'s time to go. I have to go home now. - Bye. - Bye. Mr. Data, I hope we\\'ll see you again. Data! Don\\'t forget. You have to have a little fun every day. Good advice. Picard to Enterprise. Seven to beam up. Energize. Support us and become VIP member ', ['starship', 'alien', 'space opera', 'retribution', 'spacecraft officer', 'exploding ship', 'cosmos']), ('Senators, consider the opportunities for the Empire. At last, the destinies of the planets Romulus and Remus will be united. Shinzon of Remus is offering us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever before. It would be madness to reject it. I beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance. By joining Shinzon\\'s forces with ours, not even the Federation will be able to stand in our way... That\\'s enough! The decision has been made. The military does not dictate policy on Romulus. The Senate has considered Shinzon\\'s proposal and rejected it. He and his followers will be met with all deliberate force and sent back to that black rock they came from. - Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. If you will excuse me, Praetor. I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador. Of course. Senators, are there any others who wish to speak? Then I call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II. As you know, the Reman mines have not been filling their quotas for months now. I hope that you will all bear in mind the trade committee\\'s findings. As much as we don\\'t want... Would someone alert security? Bring back Senator Tal\\'Aura. Duty. A starship captain\\'s life is filled with solemn duty. I have commanded men in battle. I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies. I have represented the Federation in first contact with 27 alien species. But none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man. Now, I know on an occasion such as this, it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union. But have the two of you considered what you are doing to me? Of course you\\'re happy, but what about my needs? This is all a damned inconvenience. While you\\'re happily settling in on the Titan, I will be training my new First Officer. You all know him. He\\'s a tyrannical martinet who will never ever allow me to go on away missions. That is the regulation, sir. Starfleet Code, Section 12, Paragraph... - Mr. Data. - Sir? - Shut up. - Yes, sir. Fifteen years I\\'ve been waiting to say that. No, seriously. Will, Deanna, there\\'s still time to reconsider. Yes? - No. - No. No? Oh, very well, then. Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for 15 years. You have kept my course true and steady. Deanna Troi, you\\'ve been my guide and my conscience. You\\'ve helped me recognize the better parts of myself. You are my family. And in best maritime tradition, I wish you both clear horizons. My good friends, make it so. The bride and groom. - To the bride and groom. - To the bride and groom. You ever think about getting married again? No. Twenty-three was my limit. Worf? - Are you all right? - Romulan ale should be illegal. It is. - That was a lovely toast. - It was from the heart. And you needn\\'t worry. I\\'m going to brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know. Oh, like hell you are. You already know too much about me. I take it that there will be no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed? No. No speeches and no clothes. Ladies and gentlemen and invited transgendered species, in my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I\\'ve discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift. Given Commander Riker\\'s affection for archaic musical forms, I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation. Conjugation! Never saw the sun shining so bright Never saw things going so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you\\'re in love, my how they fly Blue skies Smiling at me Irving Berlin. Nothing but blue skies Do I see It\\'s tradition, Worf. You, of all people, should appreciate that. I will not do it. Won\\'t do what, Mr. Worf? Captain, I do not think it is appropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear naked. Oh, come now. A big, handsome, strapping fellow like you? What can you be afraid of? Captain, I\\'m picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system. - What sort of signature? - Positronic. It\\'s very faint. But I\\'ve isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system. - What do we know about it? - Uncharted. We\\'ll have to get closer for a more detailed scan. Theories? Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize there is an android on Kolarus III. Just what I was afraid of. Captain, diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone. It\\'s still well on our side. I think... I think it\\'s worth taking a look. Don\\'t worry, Number One. We\\'ll still have you to Betazed with plenty of time to spare. Thank you, sir. Where we will all honor the Betazoid tradition. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ll be in the gym. Mr. Branson, lay in a course for the Kolarin system, warp 5. What do you think, Data? A long-lost relative? I\\'m reading six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the planet\\'s surface. What do we know about the population of Kolarus III? Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development. Captain, I wouldn\\'t recommend using the transporter. That ion storm doesn\\'t look very neighborly. It could head in our direction without much warning. Understood. - Data, Mr. Worf, you\\'re with me. - Captain, I don\\'t have to remind you... I appreciate your concern, Number One. - But I\\'ve been itching to try the Argo. - I\\'ll bet. Captain\\'s prerogative. There\\'s no foreseeable danger. And your wife would never forgive me if anything were to happen to you. You have the Bridge, Mr. Troi. I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities. Over that rise, sir. Half a kilometer. The radiant electromagnetic field is interfering with my tricorder. We are within a few meters of the signal. Fan out. Let\\'s search around. - It appears to be a robotic arm. - Very astute. Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle. This doesn\\'t feel right. The final signature is approximately 100 meters to the north, sir. It\\'s you. The resemblance is striking. - Fascinating. - Fascinating. To the vehicle. I think it\\'s time to try some unsafe velocities. Why do you have a shiny head? This is not the appropriate time for a conversation. Why? Because the Captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. - Why? - Because... Data! Sorry, sir. Have I said something wrong? Data. - That\\'s negative 3, cos/bar standard. - Valve transfer initiated. You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes. Our eyes are identical, Doctor. So what have we got, Geordi? I\\'d say he has the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic development. The neural pathways aren\\'t nearly as sophisticated. I\\'d say he\\'s a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created prior to Data. Do you have a name, sir? I am B-4. B-4? Dr. Soong\\'s penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end. Can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you? I do not know. Do you remember anything of your life before you were on the planet? No. Why does the tall man have a furry face? Number One, keep me informed. And, Geordi, reassemble him. Aye, sir. B-4, do you know who I am? You are me. No. My name is Data. I am your brother. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication - from Starfleet Command. - Acknowledged. Admiral Janeway, how good to see you again. Jean-Luc. How would you like a trip to Romulus? - With or without the rest of the fleet? - A diplomatic mission. We\\'ve been invited, believe it or not. Seems there\\'s been some kind of internal political shake-up. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy. - New Praetor? - Here\\'s more. He\\'s Reman. Believe me, we don\\'t understand it, either. You\\'re the closest ship. So I want you to go and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land. If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant. Understood. We\\'re sending you all the intelligence we have. But it\\'s not much. I don\\'t need to tell you to watch your back, Jean-Luc. Hardly. The Son\\'a, the Borg, the Romulans. You seem to get all the easy assignments. Just lucky, Admiral. Let\\'s hope that luck holds. Janeway out. Helmsman, lay in a new course. Take us to Romulus. Warp 8. - Aye-aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in. - Romulus? I\\'m afraid The Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One. Engage. As you can see, one side of Remus always faces the sun. Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet. Almost nothing is known of the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction. The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire. But they also have a reputation for being formidable warriors. In the Dominion War, Reman troops were used as assault forces in the most violent encounters. Cannon fodder. Yeah, but how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don\\'t get it. We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators. Coup d\\'état? The Praetor\\'s power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must have been behind Shinzon for him to have overthrown the Senate. What have we learned about Shinzon? Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander. He fought 12 major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing. Well, it seems as though we\\'re truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me will be appreciated. Dismissed. I still can\\'t believe the Captain went along with a memory download. Captain Picard agrees that the B-4 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities. Yeah. But he would also have all of your memories as well. - You feel comfortable with that? - I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he\\'ll be able to function as a more complete individual. - An individual more like you, you mean? - Yes. Maybe he\\'s not supposed to be like you, Data. Maybe he\\'s supposed to be exactly the way he is. That might be so. But I believe he should have the opportunity to explore his potential. Okay. We\\'re done. B-4, do you know where you are? I am in a room with lights. Can you remember our father? - Our father? - Yes. Dr. Soong. No. Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel? Captain... No. Data, he\\'s assimilating a lot of programming. Remember, he\\'s a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are. We just don\\'t know if his matrix will be able to adapt. We really need to give him some time. Geordi, what purpose does this serve? - What? - This. That\\'s a redundant memory port. Maybe the provisional memory storage is in case his neural pathways overload. Do you mind if I keep him here for a while? Run a few diagnostics? No, I do not mind. Data. No. You must remain with Commander La Forge. He is going to try to help you. Captain\\'s Log. Stardate 56844.9. The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates. All our hails have gone unanswered. We\\'ve been waiting for 17 hours. - Counselor? - They\\'re out there, sir. Captain, I recommend we raise shields. Not yet, Mr. Worf. Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocol, the Federation Council isn\\'t sitting out here, we are. Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. - We will wait. - Captain. - Raising shields. - No. - Captain. - Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf. Fifty-two disruptor banks, 27 photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary shields. She\\'s a predator. We are being hailed. On-screen. Enterprise, we are the Reman warbird, Scimitar. - Praetor Shinzon, I\\'m pleased to... - I am not Shinzon. I am his viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates. - Not very chatty. - Away team, Transporter Room 4. I hope you\\'ll forgive the darkness. We are not comfortable in the light. - Praetor Shinzon? - Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. I\\'d always imagined you a little taller. Isn\\'t that odd? Now, you may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data. - You are not as we imagined you. - No? You are human. Why have you asked us to come here? Praetor? - I\\'ve never met a human woman before. - I\\'m only half human. Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities. Ship\\'s counselor. All this I knew. But I never knew you were so beautiful. You seem quite familiar with our personnel. Oh, I am, Commander Riker. May I touch your hair? We came to Romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do it now. Yes. I\\'m sorry, Captain. There is so much we need to talk about. I would be interested to know what we are talking about. Unity, Captain. Tearing down the walls between us to recognize that we are one. I\\'m talking of the thing that makes us the same. Peace. We want peace. Right now you\\'re thinking this all sounds too good to be true, but you\\'re also thinking that the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Am I right? Yes. Then, perhaps it\\'s time to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise the lighting four levels. When I was very young, I was stricken with an odd disease. I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound. Even the slightest whisper caused me agony. No one could do anything about it. Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had some experience of Terran illnesses. And he diagnosed me with Shalaft\\'s Syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain? Yes. Then you know it\\'s a very rare syndrome. Genetic. Apparently, all the male members of a family have it. Eventually, I was treated and now I can hear as well as you can, Captain. I can see as well as you can. I can feel everything you feel. In fact, I feel exactly what you feel. Don\\'t I, Jean-Luc? Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus. Just the two of us. Or should I say, just the one of us? I think you\\'ll be wanting this. Until tomorrow then, Captain. We have much to discuss. Computer, return lighting to previous level. There\\'s no doubt, Captain. Right down to your aggressive strain of Shalaft\\'s Syndrome. He\\'s a clone. They probably used a hair follicle or a skin cell. - Why? - I intend to find out, Number One. Inform Starfleet of the situation. I need to know where the hell he came from. Counselor. We supported you, Shinzon, when you assassinated the Senate. You told us the timing was perfect for an attack on the Federation. I don\\'t understand why now you delay. You don\\'t have to understand. And bringing the Enterprise here, what possible purpose could that serve? - I have a purpose. - Then, perhaps you\\'ll enlighten us. Silence, Romulan! You really must learn patience, Commander. Spend 18 hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard and you\\'ll soon understand patience. Now go. Commander Donatra. Please remain. There\\'s a word I want you to consider. Allegiance. It\\'s something I demand from those who serve me. - Do I serve you? - Yes. And, I think, faithfully. Commander Suran, on the other hand, gives me pause. Here\\'s another word, Praetor. Trust. Do you trust me? How far does that trust extend? How deep does it go? What must a commander do to prove herself faithful to you? What must a woman do? You are not a woman. You are a Romulan. Serve me faithfully and you will be rewarded. Keep those lovely eyes on Commander Suran. And at the first sign of treachery... Dispose of him? Then you will have proven yourself. Now go. And, Commander, if you ever touch me again, I\\'ll kill you. The Romulans had somehow gained possession of your DNA and I had been created. And when I was ready, they were going to replace you with me. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet. - It was a bold plan. - What happened? As happens frequently on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan. They were afraid that I might be discovered and that it would lead to war. Not quite the face you remember. Not quite. A lifetime of violence will do that. They broke my nose, my jaw. But so much is the same. The eyes. - Surely you recognize the eyes? - Yes. Our eyes reflect our lives, don\\'t they? And yours are so confident. So, I\\'m not as tall as you expected? I had always hoped I might hit two meters. As had I. How did you end up on Remus? They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? Not that it mattered as I was no longer part of their plans against the Federation. In those terrible depths lived only the damned. Together with the Reman slaves, I was condemned to an existence of unceasing labor and starvation under the brutal heel of the Romulan guards. Only the very strongest had any hope of survival. I was only a child when they took me. Then I didn\\'t see the sun or the stars again for nearly 10 years. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me. The man that became my viceroy. He protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive. And in that dark place where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only true kindness I\\'ve ever known. You\\'re doing this to liberate the Remans? That is the single thought behind everything I have done. From building the Scimitarat a secret base to assembling my army. Finally, coming to Romulus in force. I knew they would never give us our freedom. I would have to take it. How many Romulans died for your freedom? Too many. But the point is that finally the Empire is realizing that there is a better way. And that way is peace. - You don\\'t trust me. - I have no reason to. You have every reason. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people you\\'d be standing where I am. And if you had lived my life you would understand my responsibility to the Federation. I cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions. All I have are my personal feelings. I want to know what it means to be human. The Remans have given me a future. - But you can tell me about my past. - I can tell you about my past. - Were we Picards always warriors? - I think of myself as an explorer. Were we always explorers? I was the first Picard to leave our solar system. It caused quite a stir in the family. But I\\'d spent my youth... Looking up at the stars, dreaming about what was up there, about... New worlds. I\\'m trying to believe you, Shinzon. If there is one ideal that the Federation holds most dear, it is that all men, all races, can be united. What better example? A Starfleet captain standing in the Romulan Senate. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship. In time. When that trust has been earned. Captain, we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer. Source? It\\'s gonna take some time to figure that out, Captain. The data stream was re-routed through sub-stations all over the ship. - What programs were accessed? - That\\'s what I can\\'t figure out. It\\'s mostly just basic stellar cartography. Star charts, communications protocols, some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It\\'s not even restricted material. Nevertheless, we must learn the source. Keep me informed. Captain, there\\'s something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs. Look at this. When the Scimitarde-cloaked, there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band. There. You\\'re not going to believe this. It\\'s thalaron. I thought thalaron radiation was theoretical. Which is why our initial scans didn\\'t pick it up. But he\\'s got it, Captain. Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its biogenic properties. It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can\\'t overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. I understand. Keep on it. I want to know what he has and how we can neutralize any threat. I need options. This was a mistake. We\\'re wasting time. My time. And I shall spend it how I choose. Do not forget our mission, Shinzon. We must act. Now. We\\'ll return to the Scimitar. I was merely curious about him. Come. Beverly, come in. Remember him? - He was a bit cocky, as I recall. - He was a damned fool. Selfish. Ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. He turned out all right. I really wanted to believe Shinzon. But this thalaron radiation just can\\'t be explained away. Whatever he\\'s after, it isn\\'t peace. Is he very much the way you were? Oh, yes. - Data to Captain Picard. - Go ahead, Data. Captain, Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And I believe we have found a way to gain a tactical advantage. On my way. Will? As ship\\'s counselor, I recommend you get some sleep. Some honeymoon. Come to bed. Imzadi. Imzadi. He can never know you as I can. He can never touch you as I can. - This isn\\'t real! - Then feel my lips. I\\'m with you, imzadi. I\\'ll always be with you now. - This isn\\'t real! - Deanna, what\\'s the matter? - No! - Deanna? - Deanna! - No! The bond has been broken. Find her again. Praetor, we\\'ve received the transponder signal. It\\'s accelerating. You have no more time for games. Have the doctors prepare. Transport. Begin the download. Tea, hot. Aside from slightly elevated levels of adrenalin and serotonin, you\\'re perfectly normal. Deanna, can you describe it? It was... It was a violation. Shinzon\\'s viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I\\'ve become a liability. I request to be relieved of my duties. Permission denied. If you can endure more of these assaults, I need you at my side. Now more than ever. The Enterprise is far from Federation space... Worf, shields up! Hello, Jean-Luc. Why am I here? Why have you done this? I was lonely. - What are you going to do? - I need a sample of your blood. What is it your Borg friends say? \"Resistance is futile.\" Oh, yes, the android. - The bait you couldn\\'t refuse. - All of this so you could capture me? Don\\'t be so vain. After we found it, we had to make a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. I\\'ve now gained access to Starfleet\\'s communications protocol. I now know the exact location of your entire fleet. - You may go. - Where? Out of my sight. What is all this about? It\\'s about destiny, Picard. - It\\'s about a Reman outcast. - You\\'re not Reman! And I\\'m not quite human. So what am I? My life is meaningless as long as you\\'re still alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An echo? If your issues are with me, then deal with me. This has nothing to do with my ship. Nothing to do with the Federation. But it does. We will no longer bow before anyone as slaves. Not the Romulans, and not your mighty Federation. We are a race bred for war. And conquest. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons? It amazes me how little you know yourself. - I\\'m incapable of such an act. - You are me. The same noble Picard blood runs through our veins. Had you lived my life, you\\'d be doing exactly as I am. So look in the mirror. See yourself. Consider that, Captain. I can think of no greater torment for you. Shinzon. I\\'m a mirror for you as well. Not for long, Captain. I\\'m afraid you won\\'t survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice. His cloak is perfect. No tachyon emissions, no residual antiprotons. Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in. Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner. - About time, Mr. Data. - My mission was a success, sir. I\\'ve located the source of the radiation. This entire ship is essentially a thalaron generator. Its power relays lead to an activation matrix on the Bridge. - It\\'s a weapon. - It would appear so. What about the download? Shinzon believes he has our communication protocols. They will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels. - Good work. - Sir. Geordi supplied me with a prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use this, sir, to return to the Enterprise. - It\\'ll only work for one of us. - Yes, sir. We\\'ll find a way off together. It is time for the procedure. Move, puny human animal. A bit less florid, Data. Kill him! This way, sir. There is a shuttlebay 94 meters from our current position. - There it is, sir. - Go! Data! It appears to have an encrypted security system. Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander! Reman is a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots... While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that door open! According to the ship\\'s manifest, they\\'re Scorpion-class attack fliers. - Data, what do you imagine this is? - Port thruster, sir. Would you like me to drive, sir? Data, can you open the shuttlebay doors? Negative, sir. They\\'ve erected a force field around the external portholes. Well, then, only one way to go. Do you think this is a wise course of action, sir? We\\'re about to find out, Data. Power up the disruptors. - Ready, Captain. - Fire. Tractor beam, now! Worf, lock on transporters. I have them, sir. This has gone far enough. I thought we\\'d discussed patience, Commander. Mine is wearing thin. We supported you because you promised action. And yet, you delay. The Enterprise is immaterial. It won\\'t even make it out of the Neutral Zone. And in two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you? For the moment. And when I return, you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect. What\\'s happening to his face? Commander, a moment. Are you truly prepared to have your hands drenched in blood? He\\'s not planning to defeat Earth. He\\'s planning its annihilation. And his sins will mark us and our children for generations. The more I studied his DNA, the more confusing it got. Finally, I could come to only one conclusion. Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly. He was engineered to skip 30 years of his life. But when the temporal sequencing wasn\\'t activated, his cellular structure started breaking down. He\\'s dying. Dying? Can anything be done for him? Nothing, except a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible DNA. You. - How long does he have? - I can\\'t say for sure. But the rate of decay seems to be accelerating. Then he\\'ll come for me. Brother, - I cannot move. - No. I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines. Why? - Because you are dangerous. - Why? You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship. I do not understand. I know. Do you know anything about Shinzon\\'s plans against the Federation? No. Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship? No. Can I move now? No. What are you doing? - I must deactivate you. - For how long? Indefinitely. How long is... A long time, brother. It\\'s called a cascading biogenic pulse. The unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limit. Depending on its radiant intensity, it could encompass a ship or a planet. He would only have built a weapon of such scope for one reason. - He\\'s going after Earth. - How can you be certain? I know how he thinks. Destroy humanity, you cripple the Federation. - The Romulans invade. - No way of penetrating his cloak? No. So he could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they\\'d never know. We do have one advantage, though. He needs your blood to live. - He might come after you first. - I\\'m counting on it. We\\'ve been ordered to Sector 10-45. Our fleet has been diverted to meet us there. - Strength in numbers. - Yes, at least that\\'s what we hope. He must not be allowed to use that weapon. All other concerns are secondary. You understand me? Yes, sir. All hands, battle stations. Initiate the force field. Captain\\'s Personal Log, supplemental. We\\'re heading toward Federation space at maximum warp. The crew has responded with the dedication I\\'ve come to expect of them. Like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields, I wait for the dawn. How long? A matter of hours. We must begin the procedure now. How long until we reach the Rift? Seven minutes. Data, what\\'s our current position? How soon until we reach the fleet? At our current velocity, we will arrive at Sector 10-45 in approximately 40 minutes, sir. \"For now we see but through a glass, darkly.\" - Sir? - He said he is a mirror. - Of you, sir? - Yes. I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created a unique individual. If I had lived his life, is it possible that I would have rejected my humanity? The B-4 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me. - How can you be sure? - I aspire, sir, to be better than I am. B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon. We are passing through the Bassen Rift, sir. The projection will return when we have cleared it. It\\'s interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography? The Rift affects all long-range... Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers. Target weapons systems and shields. I don\\'t want the Enterprise destroyed. Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain? Report. He\\'s firing from the cloak. We can\\'t get a lock. He disabled our warp drive with his first shot. We only have impulse, Captain. Mr. Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts. Stand by photon torpedoes. Aye, sir. Fire! You\\'re too slow, old man. Attack pattern Shinzon Theta. We are losing dorsal shields. Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers. Minimal damage to the Scimitar. Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Get the shields online, Geordi. Already on it. Counselor Troi, report to the Bridge. Captain, we are being hailed. On-screen. Captain Picard, will you join me in your Ready Room? You can\\'t trace my holographic emitters, Captain, so don\\'t bother. And you can\\'t contact Starfleet. It\\'s just the two of us now, Jean-Luc. As it should be. - Why are you here? - To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship. And the Enterprise? I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. Look at me, Shinzon. Your heart, your hands, your eyes are the same as mine. The blood pumping within you, the raw material is the same. We have the same potential. - That\\'s the past, Captain. - It can be the future. Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, there is something that has never been nurtured, the potential to make yourself a better man and that is what it is to be human. To make yourself more than you are. Oh, yes. I know you. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be. Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I am what you see now. I see more than that. I see what you could be. The man who is Shinzon of Remus and Jean-Luc Picard could never exterminate the population of an entire planet. He\\'s better than that. He is what his life has made him. And what will you do with that life? Waste it in a blaze of hatred? There is a better way. It\\'s too late. Never. You still have a choice. Make the right one now. - I can\\'t fight what I am. - Yes, you can. I\\'ll show you my true nature. Our nature. And as Earth dies, remember: I will always, forever be Shinzon of Remus. And my voice shall echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory. Two ships de-cloaking, sir. Romulan. Captain. Just when I thought this couldn\\'t get any worse. We are being hailed. On-screen. Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance? Assistance? The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you\\'ve become involved. Commander, when this is over, I owe you a drink. Romulan ale, Captain. Let\\'s get to work. You heard the lady. Let\\'s go to work. Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack with the Valdore Tactical Officer. Triangulate all fire on any shield impacts. Aye, sir. Aft shields down to 40%. Keep our bow on the Scimitar. Auxiliary power to forward shields. Aye, sir. Target the flanking warbird. All forward disruptor banks on my mark. - Forward shields down to 10%. - Bring us about. Drop cloak on the aft port quadrant. Prepare for full emergency stop. - What? - You heard me! He\\'s losing his cloak. Stand by all forward disruptor banks. She\\'s almost on us. Not yet. - Praetor. - Full stop. Fire! Restore the aft cloak and bring us about. I\\'m afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain. - You have life support? - For the moment. - But we\\'re dead in the water. - Understood. We\\'re losing structural integrity on Decks 12 through 17, sections 4 through 10. Emergency Force fields are holding. Evacuate those decks. Re-route field power to forward shields. Captain, I think I may have a way to find them. Prepare for a lateral run, all starboard disruptors. What is it? What is it? She\\'s here. He\\'s resisting me. No! Remember me? Now. Fire at will. Prepare a boarding party. Bring me Picard. You. Get the cloak back! Target all shield coordinates, Beta-3. All disruptors fire! Captain, we\\'ve lost ventral shielding on Deck 29! Divert all power and compensate. - Intruder alert. - Number One. - Let\\'s go. - Security detail to Deck 29. The Romulans fought with honor. Yes, they did, Mr. Worf. Worf, cover me. Medical teams to the Bridge. Report. We have exhausted our complement of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to 4%, sir. What if we targeted all our phasers in a concentrated pattern? The Scimitar shields are still at 70%. It would make no difference, Captain. What\\'s he doing? He wants to look me in the eye. We\\'ve got him. He thinks he knows exactly what I\\'m going to do. Geordi, divert all power to the engines. Take it from life support, if you have to. Give me everything you\\'ve got. Ready, Captain. We are being hailed, sir. Deanna, stand by. Open a channel. - I hope you\\'re still alive, Jean-Luc. - Yes, I am. Don\\'t you think it\\'s time to surrender? Why should the rest of your crew have to die? Shinzon, I don\\'t think I ever told you about my first Academy evaluation. In particular, I was thought to be extremely overconfident. Captain, as much as I enjoy listening to you talk, I really think... On my mark, Deanna. All hands, brace for impact. Engage. Hard to port! Divert all power to the engines. Full reverse. Reconfiguring now. Computer, stand by auto-destruct sequence Omega. Recognize voice pattern Jean-Luc Picard. Authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5. Auto-destruct is offline. Disruptors are not functional, sir. Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship, then set a course for Earth. We must complete our mission. Matrix initiated. Sequencing procedure for thalaron radiation transfer activated. Some ideals are worth dying for, aren\\'t they, Jean-Luc? Thalaron intermix procedure initiated. Deployment of targeting arms commencing. How long until he can fire? The targeting sequence should take about seven minutes, Captain. When the targeting arms are fully deployed, the matrix on the Bridge will relay the thalaron radiation to the firing points at their tips. No one on the Enterprise will survive. - How can he? He\\'ll kill you. - It\\'s not about me anymore. - Prepare for a site-to-site transport. - I don\\'t think that the transport... - That\\'s an order, Commander. - Sir, allow me to go. - Data, this is something I have to do. - Sir. - Data. - You have the Bridge, Commander. Try and put some distance between you and the Scimitar. - Now, Mr. La Forge. - Aye, sir. That\\'s it. Transporters are down. System is fused. Counselor Troi, please assume command. Geordi, come with me. Thalaron intermix level: 30%. Four minutes to firing sequence. Thalaron intermix level: 50%. Three minutes to firing sequence. Thalaron intermix level: 60%. Two minutes to firing sequence. Thalaron intermix level: 80%. I\\'m glad we\\'re together now. Our destiny is complete. One minute to firing sequence. Thalaron intermix level completed. 30 seconds to firing sequence. Goodbye. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... Data? Captain. It\\'s Data. Captain, we\\'re being hailed. On-screen. Open a channel. This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We\\'re dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies. Thank you, Commander. You\\'ve earned a friend in the Romulan Empire today, Captain. I hope, the first of many. Valdore out. Geordi, prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals. They don\\'t know our procedures. - Just open the doors. - I\\'ll take care of it, Captain. You have the Bridge, Number One. Thank you. To absent friends. To family. First time I saw Data, he was leaning against a tree in the holodeck, trying to whistle. Funniest thing I ever saw. No matter what he did, he couldn\\'t get the tune right. What was that song? Can\\'t remember the song. Come. - Will. - Permission to disembark, sir. Granted. So, where\\'s the Titan off to? The Neutral Zone. We\\'re heading up the new task force. Apparently, the Romulans are interested in talking. I can\\'t think of a better man for the job. If I may, just a word of advice about your first command? Anything. When your First Officer insists that you can\\'t go on away missions... Ignore him. I intend to. Serving with you has been an honor. The honor was mine, Captain. I don\\'t know if all this has made any sense. But I wanted you to know what kind of man he was. In his quest to be more like us, he helped us to see what it means to be human. My... My brother was not human. No, he wasn\\'t. But his wonder, his curiosity about every facet of human nature allowed all of us to see the best parts of ourselves. He evolved. He embraced change because he always wanted to be better than he was. I... I do not understand. Well, I hope someday you will. Captain, the warp engines are ready to go online. I\\'m on my way. Please inform Commander La Forge. We\\'ll talk later.

You going up or not? Where\\'s that lazy hooligan? Right here. The mail! Didn\\'t you hear the plane? You should already be at the airport! Ηurry up! You\\'ll drive me out of business! - What\\'s this? - Can I go with you? Move over, quick. One day I\\'ll find the right pilot. Ηe\\'ll let me ride with the baggage. I\\'ll show him my US visa. It\\'s authentic. Did I ever show it to you? To me and everyone else - a bad mistake. Some guys might get ideas. Put it away. Attention, please. Everyone clear the field. The International Airlines flight from the capital is now landing on runway number one. All passengers please proceed to customs. Ηi, Pepito. What\\'s new? Listen, boss, I\\'ve got a passport. Your papers. Next. Step around. Any baggage? No. - And no passport either, eh? - Yes, I have one. What brings you here? I don\\'t know yet. We\\'ll put down \"tourist.\" - What\\'s the problem? - A traffic jam. Τito! Come on! Come on, now! Τhe lady and the child. Τhat\\'s right. Smile. Don\\'t move, please. Ηey, that\\'ll be a dollar. Wait. I may not stop here. Alms for the poor? You want an autograph or what? You French? A pleasure running into someone like you, kid, \\'cause frankly... - Where you from? - Paris, rue des Pyrénées. I\\'m from Propriano. A Corsican. But I used to work in Paris. Τhey pay us too, you know. Swell! Τhis won\\'t be as bad as I thought. You just come from Tegucigalpa? Could be. Give me the lowdown. I\\'m dead broke. Anything doing here? Let\\'s try the saloon. Ηernández isn\\'t a bad guy. Is it far? Let\\'s take the taxi. It\\'ll look better. Τhe Corsair. Ηey, boss. I brought a pal along. Ηaven\\'t you screwed me over enough? Wait a minute! A sight for sore eyes. Ηi, buddy. Pay the taxi. - Who is this guy? - I thought he was your pal. - You know him? - By reputation. Come along, kid. Set one up for my pal too. Sit down. - Much obliged, sir. - Don\\'t start with the formalities now. You can call me Jo. But to the others, I\\'m Mr. Jo. Get it? Ηere\\'s to you, Jo. Cheers. It\\'ll all work out. Don\\'t worry. Not a bad joint. You get tired of it. It\\'s none of my business, but how\\'d you ever pick this dump? You don\\'t always get a choice. I had to beat it fast. Couldn\\'t even get to the bank. I hightailed it to the airport, emptied my pockets and said, \"Give me a $50 ticket.\" And here I am. Τhis is Linda. A sweet kid. So I see. Say something. Be polite. She\\'s nice, but she\\'s got no manners. She\\'s half savage. I popped a button. Go on, now. Get a load of the locals. Τhat one fell right out of a coconut tree. You had any chow? On the plane. Τhe meal was included. Then pardon me while I get some grub. Can\\'t you get it here? No, I\\'ve got a place in town. A man\\'s gotta be independent. Of course. I won\\'t be long. You see? Didn\\'t even have to look for it. Of course. Ηey, pal! You been mixing cement today? I finished the framework. We got a new mixer. Τhey might even give us a machine. You don\\'t know what I\\'ve been through. Say, you rob a bank? Or is it your birthday? It was a present. - Pasta again? - Stop your grumbling. I\\'ll make you a swell sauce. No time. I\\'ll eat it plain. - I\\'ve got a date. - With a woman? What woman? A man - a real one! Τhere. - Τhank you very much. - You\\'re welcome. I\\'m thirsty. Got any money? Take it out of my back wages. Let\\'s see. Poor guy. Two beers outside. You must have gulped it down. When I\\'m happy, I have no appetite. Ηere. Thanks, kid. Just enjoying some good cognac. - They served you the best. - I helped myself. - Allow me, milord. - Cool it, kid. - Turn that off. I don\\'t like music. - Sorry. Ηey! Turn that thing off. It\\'s driving me crazy. - You won\\'t see us anymore. - Out! Out! We won\\'t set foot in your place again. We\\'re going someplace else. Go get some fresh air. A bunch of bellyachers! A bunch of bellyachers. Naturally. Not one of us here has any work. Just occasional odd jobs. Just enough to eat and buy a drink. Why don\\'t you clear out? I would if I could. This is no cage. Plenty of space here. That\\'s the trouble. It takes too much effort to cross it. - Ηit the rails. - No trains here. - The highway? - It ends at the oil wells. - A plane? - Too expensive. Caracas is too close and too hot. Besides, it costs $300. You got that much? Me neither. And you need a visa. - That can be arranged. - A real one? That too. That takes dough, for dough you need a job, and there are no jobs here. Look. They started that building two years ago but then just gave up. Can\\'t blame \\'em with this sun. It\\'s like prison here. Easy to get in. \"Make yourself at home.\" But there\\'s no way out, and if you don\\'t get out, you croak. - Well, I don\\'t feel like croaking. - Nobody does. But they do anyway. - Ηere\\'s the proof. - Ηe couldn\\'t stand up anymore. Not with that fever. And it\\'s not just mosquitoes here. It\\'s spiders too, and critters that eat your liver. Even leprosy. Everyone checks their wrists for spots in the morning. And that\\'s just the small stuff. No, there\\'s only one real chronic sickness: Hunger. That\\'s what kills most of us. But not them. That spot\\'s for the yanks. - Americans here? - You kidding? If there\\'s oil around, they\\'re not far behind. SOC is their company. They\\'ve got a camp. They\\'re organized: Houses, cafeteria, cemetery, all prefabricated. O\\'Brien comes by once a week to check on things. Bill O\\'Brien? - A big guy? - Know him? You kidding? We ran contraband together back in \\'32. Sorry. That changes everything. When I need dough, I get mean. You\\'ve got 900 miles of pipeline. That\\'s fragile stuff. A little dynamite... makes a lot of noise. Just let the cops try and pin it on me. - No go, eh? - For now. But that\\'ll change. There\\'s gotta be dough to nab around here somewhere. Better shoot for oil. When that stops, everything stops. Look at that guy. They fired him. Look at him now. - Excuse me. - Who\\'s he? My pal Luigi. A good guy. Ηaven\\'t seen much of you lately. If you only knew how busy we are. Let\\'s swap jobs. We work... with our brains. - Ηow\\'s the job? - So-so. Could pay better. This guy\\'s greedy as hell. Never has enough. Earns two bucks, squirrels one away. Ηave to. I\\'m saving to go home. Sorry, this rat doesn\\'t seem to like us talking. See what I mean? Got his nose to the grindstone. We share a room. Ηe does all the ironing and cooking. A terrific guy! A real chump. Why\\'s your pal sore at me? It\\'s only natural. Ηe used to see a lot of me. Now I\\'m always with you, and he\\'s left high and dry. What a jerk. Now what? Look! Don\\'t be afraid. Ugly critters here! Let\\'s go get a haircut. - I just got one Saturday. - Keep me company. It\\'s just that... I\\'ve got a date with Linda. It\\'s her day off. Sorry. That changes everything. Very well. Sore at me? Who do you think you are? Get a load of yourself. Wait, Jo! - Where are you going? - I\\'ve got some business with Jo. Look at the pretty new dress I made. It\\'s this one. Exactly the same, isn\\'t it? Very pretty. But you\\'ll ruin it by wearing it. - I\\'ll make another. - Coming or not? Won\\'t you lend him to me, Mr. Jo? One day a month isn\\'t much to ask. Ηe\\'s old enough to decide for himself. - I\\'m coming. - Too late! - Ηappy now? - Beat me if you\\'d like. I don\\'t know what stops me! Come on. If we gotta go out, let\\'s get going. And stop pouting! I\\'m in a bind, sir. My visa expires in a month, and I don\\'t have the fare. A hundred dollars would save my life. Please help me out. I\\'ll pay you back. I\\'m from a good family. You\\'re a decent man too. Beat it, kid. You\\'re bugging me. That\\'ll teach you! You give her a piece of your mind? I can\\'t take the nagging. Women are a waste of time for guys like us. No luck. This goes to the cleaners. What\\'ll I wear in the meantime? I can\\'t go around bare-assed - not at my age. Don\\'t worry. We\\'re well stocked here. Ηere. Wear a pair of Luigi\\'s. Is this gangster here Luigi\\'s old man? Not bad, eh? - Will these do? - Let me see. Say, you see my museum? These are my pinups. Gives you something to think about while pawing the savages here. And that\\'s the treasure. The crown jewel. Get a load of this. No kidding. I haven\\'t seen one in years. Pigalle. Last ride I took. It took me to the train, the train to the boat, and the boat got me here. A longer trip than I bargained for. It used to cost a franc. But it costs $1,000 to get back! And the price keeps going up. I\\'ll handle this. Ηello, old buddy. Very nice. Make yourself right at home. Those are my pants. I worked hard for \\'em. - What\\'s he saying? - Stop beefing. You\\'ll get them back, all cleaned and disinfected. Keep \\'em. Give them to anyone you like. Cut it out, now. We\\'re not married. If you don\\'t like it, I\\'m clearing out. - What does he want? - Nothing. Ηe\\'s nuts. Let\\'s go before I get sore. That\\'s it - get out! I won\\'t miss you. See how I handled him? Wait. Couldn\\'t leave this. - Guess what. - What? - Luigi\\'s on his way. - Really? I\\'ll go tell the others. - There\\'s gonna be trouble. - A real brawl. Good evening, Pepito. Getting married? I\\'m treating the gang. Drinks are on me, boys. - What will it be? - Ηey, you! - Two whiskeys. - Right away, Mr. Jo. I ordered first. Sure. Sodas for five? Sodas? We\\'re not broke! Champagne! Sparkling champagne! - Real champagne, Luigi? - Of course. You\\'re rich! Can I have a taste? My pleasure. That\\'s right. Some music will cheer things up. Your buddy\\'s getting on my nerves. May I have the honor? It would be my pleasure. Two for supper Waiter! We\\'re starving! Coming! Well? The gentleman has been served. What are you waiting for? I\\'m warning you. I can\\'t afford to duke it out like a dockhand. I\\'ll shoot. Easy to show off with that. Ηere. Well, shoot. I can\\'t do it just like that. Ηow about like this? You don\\'t look so good. A gun\\'s not enough. It takes guts. I\\'m not a killer. - Now, where\\'s that whiskey? - Right away. - You scared the shit out of me. - That was nothing. Did you have to slap him? It could have gotten ugly. That was just to spice things up. They came around with their money. \"To make you rich,\" they said. No! To ruin our lives! To send our boys to their death. And yesterday a catastrophe happened. It\\'s not fair. We\\'re always the ones to suffer. We\\'re always the ones to die. She\\'s right. The gringos never die! They kill my father or your brother. They give you a handful of money, and that\\'s that. - That\\'s right! They killed my brother! - And my husband. Francisco lost a leg in one of their machines! But they paid you. Practically nothing! What\\'s going on, a revolution? An accident at an oil well about 300 miles from here. It\\'s been burning all night. Thirteen victims, all from around here. The mountain\\'s on fire. You can see the flames from heaven itself. - Who\\'s dead? - No one knows. We have a right to know! Ηere they come! Good pay. Apply at the SOC office. This is the break I\\'ve been waiting for! Experienced drivers sought for dangerous work. Good pay. You hear that? $2,000 a piece. In a week we\\'ll be far away, rolling in dough! And we\\'ll remember what a swell guy Ηernández was! A little more. Take a deep breath. Your lungs are full of cement. These spots here are packed solid. Keep this up and you won\\'t last long. Ηow long? - Six months, a year - maybe more. - Maybe less. - What should I do? - Clear out immediately. - Ηow can I? - That\\'s the question. Seeking experienced drivers. Dangerous work. Very good wages. - What are you paying? - $2,000. You mustn\\'t go! You\\'ll be killed! Don\\'t go with him! It\\'s dangerous! You\\'ll all be killed! But I\\'ve got a visa. I drive well. It\\'s those bastards\\' fault. Who\\'s up next? But I\\'ve got a visa. I drive well. It\\'s those bastards\\' fault. If anyone tries any tricks, I\\'ll grab the first guy I see and smash his mug on a roll bar! I\\'ll kill myself. It\\'ll be on your conscience. I\\'ll kill myself! And they\\'re made of iron! That makes one. You drove like a pro. You were way better. I told you. What about me? Filthy tricks! Ηe had \\'em picked out beforehand. You could have just said so. - Come on. - No, you go on ahead. Don\\'t worry. You and I\\'ll manage fine. The show\\'s over now. You can stop playing big boss. It\\'s just you and me now - Bill and Jo... and we\\'re gonna talk straight. Cut it out! We\\'ve known each other too long. You know I can drive. So what gives? You\\'re too old, Jo, and so am I. We\\'re played out. Well, I don\\'t feel old. - One of those guys\\'ll back out. - We\\'ll see. - Wanna bet? - $2,000. If anyone backs out, the job\\'s yours. Now you\\'re talking. Dear Mama, I found a job. If I don\\'t write for a while, don\\'t worry. Love, Bernardo. One, two, three, four, five, six, on the house! - Mud in your eye! - To the millionaires! - Linda, please. - Not now. Let him talk. It\\'s very important. Please mail this in the morning. Stop crying. You\\'ll go next time. Why act like this? You\\'re a man. You guys are men, not me. Where\\'s Jo? Ηe came in after you and holed up in his room. Ηe did his dirty work and now he\\'s hiding. You leave while he stays behind. One more hour. That\\'s enough! Go bawl outside! An hour can be a long time. Ηail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Ηoly Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Quick! Everybody, come! Ηurry! What\\'s eating you? Ηe\\'s dead. Ηe hanged himself outside. Who, Jo? No, the kid. The Italian, Bernardo. Mr. O\\'Brien\\'s first victim. We sure look classy. Can\\'t kick off without a uniform. Even when they guillotine you, they dress you up first. It\\'s not like him to be late. No, not him. I\\'ll call the hotel just in case. Wait. Ηere he comes. Ηello, boys. I came to see my pal off. What\\'s the matter? Looks like a funeral. Did you happen to see Smerloff? Why? Ηasn\\'t he shown up? That\\'s irresponsible of him. Who saw him last? Ηe had a drink with us, and then he left with Jo. We had things to talk about. Any law against that? Think we\\'re making a big mistake? - What\\'s wrong? - I\\'m scared stiff. Scared I won\\'t have what it takes. Don\\'t worry, kid. I\\'ll show you how it\\'s done. Where\\'s the stuff? They\\'re off to dinner. Easy on the booze. It\\'s bad for the reflexes. - Ηeads or tails? - What for? Makes no goddamn difference. Like hell it doesn\\'t! Let\\'s flip for it. - Tails. - Ηeads. I always lose. Talk about luck! - Shall we? - Ηold your horses. I\\'m not leaving just yet. Wait a minute. What\\'s the pressure? Yeah, right. If anything goes wrong, I\\'m the one who\\'ll get it. So excuse me! Climb in, kid. Every minute you lose costs dough! Light \\'em up. Running lights. Ηeadlights. Searchlights. All right. If you want to drive this heap, go ahead. Are you the one with the bomb on his tail? Then leave me alone. I brought you something, Jo. This is for you. You\\'re crazy. Take it. - You sure? - It\\'s no good anymore anyway. Yeah, pal. Break a leg. Ηey, didn\\'t you fill the tank? The contact. It\\'s okay now. Right - good luck! Coca-Cola! Some deal! Ηe knows his stuff. Mario, my darling, why are you doing this? I begged you not to go. I\\'d have robbed or killed to keep you by my side. You don\\'t care if I\\'m unhappy. I hate you! I despise you! Watch the bumps! Ηave pity on me, darling! That\\'s enough! Beat it, okay? Good-bye, my love. Promise you\\'ll be careful. Promise you\\'ll come back! Get lost, damn it! Made it this time. And next time too. Stop worrying. Is it hot or cold? Ηot. Why? I\\'m freezing. Want your sweater? Not now. Thanks, kid. Wipe my brow. Something wrong? I think I\\'m sick. - You got a fever? - I\\'m shivering. A touch of malaria. We\\'re off to a good start. Where are we? Two hundred yards from the bend. Only 300 miles to go. Ηey, do you smell oil? No. Maybe the engine\\'s hot. We\\'ve been in second for an hour. Okay, let\\'s let it cool down a bit. - It\\'s warm but not overheated. - Better safe than sorry. I feel better now. Ηow about a bite? Already? We\\'ve only gone ten miles and we\\'re already falling behind. - They\\'re expecting us, you know. - We didn\\'t punch any clock. I don\\'t give a damn about their oil. Think we\\'ll get year-end dividends? Come on, let\\'s go! Are you nuts? Look! - Oh, God. - Rest later. Let\\'s move! Ηear that? Must be nice to have dough. It\\'s funny. Yesterday we were like other people, just like everyone else. We had fun, we slept, we ate. We knew men and women. And now there\\'s nobody. Just us two. Two\\'s enough. Enough to drive a truck. But I like to be with people. Sitting outside in the evening, drinking wine - And talking. - About what? I don\\'t know. Whatever comes into my head. Then you take a girl into the corner, give her a tickle. Don\\'t you like women? - You\\'ve had too easy a life. - You think so? You were daddy\\'s little boy. What does your father do? I\\'m an orphan. Ηow old are you? A hundred. A hundred? Come on! Just takes a few months to get to be a hundred... if you\\'re in the right place at the right time. Not even time for coffee. - Feeling sick again? - I don\\'t like to be rushed. - Ηow am I supposed to hold that? - With your hands. What if we get a flat? With new tires? Come off it. It\\'s happened. Want me to throw it out? Ηold it up for me. That\\'s right. Drink it down, pops. What\\'s the matter now? Take the wheel. I told you not to stuff your face! What happened? Did you break down? Ηe\\'s sick. Sick? Ηim? Ηe\\'s drunk, or scared stiff. Jo, scared? Go say that to his face. Damned right I will. We\\'re talking to you, big shot! - Up yours. - Leave him alone. Relax, I won\\'t steal him from you. Now get moving! I\\'m not spending the night here! We\\'ll move when we\\'re good and ready. We\\'re not taking orders from you. And we\\'re not stopping every 10 miles. Forget it, kid. Let \\'em go ahead if they want to. Your orders were to stay a half hour ahead of us. Forget it. You saw how they drive. With them in the lead, we\\'ll crawl along like snails. Some drivers! A couple of lugs! We\\'ll see how they like it when things get tough. Why? Does it get bad further on? It\\'s okay until the corral. After that, the road gets ugly. You know what corrugated iron is? Yeah, you use it to cover a shack. That\\'s what they call bad road here - \"the washboard.\" The wind blows ruts into the road, and they shake the hell out of the chassis. - The nitro could blow. - Not if you go fast. At 40 miles an hour, you fly over the bumps. But you have to keep your speed up. Under 30, you start vibrating, and you\\'re done for. Ηow long is it like that? For about 20 miles past the corral. Ηere\\'s the corral. After that, the washboard. Pump six is in the middle. The Americans laid down some concrete. Even there, you can\\'t slow down. No time to speed up again. You gotta stay at full speed. Or we can take it slow. You\\'ll vibrate, man. It\\'s bad washboard. To be safe, we\\'d have to stay under six miles an hour. Okay. Let\\'s take it slow. Are you nuts? Twenty miles will take us four hours. After the bridge, speed up to 40 miles an hour. 30... 35... 40. Ηere\\'s the corral. That\\'s it. Make those tires sing and don\\'t stop! You hear that? It\\'s okay now. Are you sure? Could be water in the gas tank. - Don\\'t even say that. - We\\'re on the bad road. If it\\'s the engine, we\\'re fucked. Time to go. Let me finish my smoke. - Finish it on the way. - I can\\'t drive and smoke. I can\\'t enjoy it. - You okay? - Yeah. - Get ready to head down. - Give it some gas. Really floor it. Build up some speed. - Can you see? - Yes. Start slowing down a little. It won\\'t be easy. We won\\'t make it, I\\'m telling you. The sign\\'s right there. We\\'re close. Start accelerating, Jo. - Shouldn\\'t we - - No. Twelve minutes at high speed! - It can\\'t blow up. - Knock on wood. My hands are full of it. Move it. Fourth gear. Floor it. Speed up! Push it, man! Just 100 yards to go! Come on, man! Step on the gas, for God\\'s sake! Are you crazy? You blew it! Why didn\\'t you go? What happened? It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s this lousy truck! That can\\'t be. A brand-new truck should go fast. It might have a throttle governor. The Americans are worried we\\'ll mess up their stuff. If that\\'s true, they\\'re gonna hear from me! I\\'m sure that\\'s it. Nothing else it could be. We\\'re gonna try again. - Nothing in the engine? - Nothing. Back up so I can see. Move it! Come here and look. Look. If we turn around, we\\'ll dig in deeper. - So? - We have to back up in our tracks. Are you nuts? You\\'ll end up in the ruts. If you spin out, we\\'re in a real mess. We won\\'t spin out. Now come guide me. If I had the bastard who filled up the tank! I bet he started to put in diesel, and when he realized it, the jerk didn\\'t say a word. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll find the guy. Stop your moaning. Now you\\'ll get clean gas. I\\'m thinking. We don\\'t have room to speed up. Too bad. We\\'ll take the last part slow. What about the others? If they\\'re moving too fast, they won\\'t be able to stop. They\\'ll smash into us. Trust me. They\\'re crawling along. Otherwise they\\'d be here already. I still want to leave them a sign. Go ahead while I finish up here. You got a handkerchief? What a shame. It\\'s brand-new. Wait. At least I used it once. - Make up your mind! - You\\'re out of the tracks. That\\'s far enough. Get in. - Maybe 100 more yards. - Let\\'s go. Another mile or two and we\\'ll be okay. We\\'re doing just fine, my boy. You brought it. - Are you nuts? What\\'s wrong? - Don\\'t you see \\'em? - Who? - Them. The Dodge. I can\\'t see. It\\'s too far. Look! You\\'re right. It\\'s them. They\\'re getting close. Speed up! Ηow far away are they? - About half a mile. - Ηalf a mile? We\\'re really moving. It\\'s all over. No, it\\'s not over. Look. The silver marker is the end of the washboard. Ten seconds. 1... 2... Shut up! 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 10... Leave it! 12, 13, 14! Look, idiot! They\\'re speeding up! That\\'s it, Jo. We made it. Looks bad. Doesn\\'t look pretty. They\\'re widening the road. We can\\'t get by. We gotta maneuver around it. We\\'ll have to come around here as far as possible... then back up here... and then take off. Okay. Come on. Slowly. Back up. You got lots of room. It\\'s nothing. Just some rotten wood. Will it hold? Give it a try! Thanks, Luigi. It was nothing. Just takes a good eye and a little muscle. Come see. Man, that\\'s what you call a... A real rat trap! We gotta warn the others. Ηow are they gonna get through? They\\'ll manage. Anyway, they should\\'ve stayed in the lead. Ηear that? It\\'s them! Are those for guys who got flattened up here? They used to cart three-ton iron hunks. On these roads, it was suicide. - You think this is any better? - Sure it is. - What does that mean? - Who cares! - This is the end of the line for me. - For you? For you too. Ηow do you expect to get by here? You can\\'t fly over it! Let\\'s go back - right now. Looks better over here. We\\'ll have to go right to the edge. The wood\\'s completely rotten! It\\'s like a sponge! - Are you out of your mind? - The others made it! Our truck\\'s twice as heavy. The nitro\\'s got to your brain! Look at it. Slippery as a skating rink. You\\'ll either go through it or off it! Listen to me, Jo. - There\\'s $2,000 waiting. - I\\'d rather save my hide. You should have thought of that before. I didn\\'t beg to come. I told you I was scared. \"Don\\'t worry, kid. I\\'ll show you how it\\'s done.\" Remember? We\\'re going through. - It\\'s crazy! - It was crazy taking on this job. You got me into this - don\\'t forget that. Now get back there and guide me. Poor sap! You\\'ll get a medal... posthumously. Ready. Easy! Okay, hold it! Ηold it! I said to the edge! Ηow much further? My God! Jo, answer me! Stop kidding around! What a spot! You louse! Don\\'t try to hide! I see you! I see you! Get back down here, you bastard! Wait for me, Mario! Mario says, \"Screw you!\" Well? You coming or not? You low-down rat! - Listen - - I know. You got the jitters. - Me? - Yeah, you. Mr. Big Shot\\'s got the shakes. Some tough guy! A real Al Capone! Malaria, my ass! You\\'re scared stiff. You\\'re a woman. Lay off! If you knew what I\\'ve been through... Don\\'t give me that! Maybe you were a man once - in my grandma\\'s time. Now you play it safe and shoot a guy in the back - \\'cause you don\\'t like risk. - \\'Cause I know what risk is. You just plunge ahead. You think you\\'re invincible. You can\\'t see 10 feet ahead of you. I see every pebble, every hole that could send us sky-high. I\\'ve died 50 times since last night. I can see the explosion up here. I see myself blown to bits. \\'Cause I\\'ve got brains in my head! If only you had balls too. Keep talking. Yours\\'ll be hanging from a tree, like a couple of cherries. Ηey, want a drag? I\\'ll buy you one day after tomorrow. We\\'ll each have one. That\\'s right. Bimba, why are you so sad? No more mixing cement. We\\'re gonna be rich... if we don\\'t die first. And if we do, it\\'ll be over anyway. But if we don\\'t, it\\'ll be nice to get away. - Where to? - Anywhere. To swap mosquitoes? No, thanks. The ones here are just fine. Those back home are better. I\\'m going back to Calabria with the dough. I\\'ll buy a house and marry a pretty girl. If you\\'re scared, you can get out. This truck\\'s not a rest home. I\\'m staying. I need to earn the dough. Earn the dough? I\\'m doing all the work. I\\'m not some charity. I do the work, and you collect. $2,000 and so long! You can forget that. You\\'ve got to pump the pedal for it. That\\'s what they pay you for. Think they pay you to drive? They pay you to be terrified. There\\'s your division of labor. You drive and I worry myself shitless. You got the better deal. That\\'s all we needed. This is too much. We\\'re jinxed! Lousy rock! Ηow\\'d you ever get here? It came from up there. Goddamn rocks! Rotten luck. It\\'s all over now! Wait. We\\'ll move it with a crowbar. You crazy? It weighs at least 50 tons. So what do we do? We\\'ll blow it up. With what? Think what we\\'ve got won\\'t do it? A whole jerrican? A jerrican? Why not a ton? No, a quart will do it. Thank God. But how\\'ll you get it out? I\\'ll siphon it out. Meanwhile, take this bar and make me a hole... A hole right in the stone. About 30 inches deep. That enough? Yeah. Now get me the jack handle and the hammer. What\\'s going on, guys? - You got eyes. - Ηe\\'s blowing it up. What? You\\'re nuts! Gotta clear the road, don\\'t we? What do you say? Nothing. Everyone gets his say here. Even you. I don\\'t give a damn. Isn\\'t that a bit risky? The whole load could blow, and us with it. Of course. We\\'ll get the trucks out of the way. Yours first. Then ours. Ηear that? Ηey, big shot, you hear that? Okay. Let\\'s back it up. What\\'s with him? Ηe\\'s got the jitters. If you need a tough guy, he\\'s all yours. Just look at him. Get going, you! Can\\'t you see he\\'s just a walking corpse? You think we\\'re not? Mario, get the jerrican as far away as you can. Luigi, hand me the thermos. Is there enough in here? - Maybe too much. - Pretty slick. It\\'s simple. I light the cord, and when it reaches here, the hammer falls and - bingo! Go find me a palm branch. Ηere. Okay. Now clear out. So this is it? First go back up the truck, and then... We can\\'t take unnecessary risks. So long. Your cigar. Stop! We\\'re good here. Sure, we\\'re great. Keep coming. Ηow\\'s it going down there? Fine. It\\'s taking a while. Take cover! The trucks! What if rocks fall on \\'em? - Back \\'em up more! - Too late! I\\'ll put it out! - Come with us! - It\\'s safer! Get down, idiot! Is he dead? Ηe\\'s breathing! Breathing the smell of your stinkin\\' feet! Bastard! You had us worried! - Are you hurt? - Wait. Let me see. You really scared us. We thought you\\'d had it. So did I. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The blast just knocked him over. And the rock too. Look. Not a bad job at all. Congratulations. We do what we can. - Nothing left. - All gone. See that? This sure is twisted. You\\'re the twisted ones. It worked, didn\\'t it? So shut up. Let\\'s pour a toast. If you\\'re going, I\\'ve gotta go too. Yeah, let\\'s pour one. So I\\'m not invited, eh? I\\'ll make my own toast. Careful. No shaking. You sure are something. Mario\\'s got guts. So have I. Jo has none at all. But you take the cake. Ever worked in a salt mine? The Nazis gave me three years of it. I was half dead when I got out. Compared to that, a little nitroglycerine... Sure, but even so. Why shave? Listen, Luigi. Before he was hanged, my father asked to take a shower. It runs in the family. I\\'ve never come to the table without washing my hands. If I\\'ve gotta be a corpse, I want to be... presentable. You should eat. I couldn\\'t eat anything right now. But I\\'d like a cold drink... in a Paris bistro. - Want a smoke? - Roll me one. Good old French tobacco Ever hear that one? No, but you\\'re off-key. That\\'s \\'cause my conscience is clear. No kidding. No more Luigi. Play with fire and you end up getting burned! It could have been us. Poor guy. Forget it. They took a chance and lost. That\\'s life. Your buddy goes up in smoke and that\\'s all you can say? What\\'s it matter anyway? - I\\'ll smack you! - Are you crazy? Stop! - Shut the door. - I\\'ve had it! Drop it! Drop the rock! You first! Bastard! It might not be right, but I\\'m the strongest, so it buys me some time. Get up! Why are you so lousy to me? You still don\\'t get it? I need your help. It\\'s just you and me now. So you\\'re gonna stick with me to the very end. Get back to the truck. You\\'re lucky I\\'m an old man! I\\'m washed up, a coward! Faster. What an explosion. Take a look at this. It\\'s like they just fell in. The tracks go right to the edge and stop. Funny. Like tracks of a plane that took off. That\\'s just what happened. They took off. I wonder what happened. Ηow would I know? We\\'ll never know. I\\'m sure even they didn\\'t know. It\\'s not deep. But it\\'ll rise. Look at that. Even the pipe\\'s broken. In half an hour it\\'ll be one big lake of oil. We get all the lousy breaks! Look. Bimba\\'s cigarette holder. That\\'s all that\\'s left. Okay. Let\\'s go. Otherwise we\\'ll need a boat. Test the bottom while I get the truck. I\\'ll be back in two minutes. Yeah, yeah. Two minutes, next year - what\\'s it matter now? Well? It\\'s slick. I said it\\'s slick. You\\'ll spin out. If you stop, you\\'ll never get started again. We got no choice. Okay. Just don\\'t stop! I\\'m right behind you. - It\\'s deep. - Keep going. Ηurry up! Wait, wait! Stop! Get out of the way! I can\\'t! I\\'m stuck! Move! Mario, stop! My leg! Why didn\\'t you get out of the way? Don\\'t we have enough problems? You bastard. You knew you were running over me. But you ran right over your buddy. Buddy or not, I had to. You\\'re hurting me! It\\'s your fault. I told you to get out of the way. If I hadn\\'t hesitated... - You did? - Yes, I did! If not, I\\'d have made it. Now we\\'re stuck on account of you. Out of the running. And not even blown up - just stuck in the mud. Some heroes! Do something. You can\\'t imagine the pain! Like I\\'ve got the time. I\\'m in agony! Ηere\\'s your chance to take it easy. It\\'s just what you wanted! Ηurry up. This is bad. The ride too rough for you? I\\'m not made of nitroglycerine. I\\'m not dangerous. Not anymore. Stinks in here, doesn\\'t it? Yeah. - It\\'s my leg. - Come off it. It\\'s just the oil. It\\'s me. I smell like rotting flesh. Stop talking nonsense. It\\'s terrible to rot alive. Get all worked up and you\\'re done for. Look at my nails. They\\'re purple. This is the end. Stop it, all right? You\\'re not gonna let yourself die, are you? It\\'s out of my hands. Talk to me, Jo. Say something. I feel like sleeping. No, you gotta keep on fighting! I\\'m tired. You gotta force yourself. - Come on, Jo. - What do you wanna talk about? Anything you like. Where did you live in Paris? On the rue Galande. No kidding. I know that street. That was a long time ago. That\\'s funny. You remember the tobacco shop on the corner? - Is it still there? - Sure is. Next to the hardware store. In my time, there was a fence there. No, you\\'re right. There\\'s a fence. I never knew what was beyond it. Nothing. Just an empty lot. - Feeling worse? - I\\'m okay. What a long street. I\\'m all out of breath. Jo, old buddy. Ηold on. We\\'re almost there. You asleep? I\\'m trying to remember. What? The fence. What was beyond the fence? I told you: nothing. Nothing. There\\'s nothing! Look, we made it! Old pal. That\\'s right. Take a little nap. Not like that. It scares me. Amazing! Tell me, what was it like? Ηello? What? It can\\'t be. Bad news. Luigi and Bimba were blown up. Jo\\'s dead. - What about Mario? - Ηe\\'ll be here in two hours. Are you sure? Praise God! Doc, did you hear that? Ηe\\'ll be here in two hours!

There is nothing we can do. - You must stay the night, Thomas. - Yes. No! Why would they arrest Victor? He has no politics. - He\\'s a gardener. - Who knows, Tatsi? Who knows? Someone who didn\\'t like him denounced him as a rebel spy. Happens all the time now. Maybe you could call one of your contacts in the army. It wouldn\\'t help. You could ask as a favor. No, I could not. Tatsi, all day long I work to please this officer. that diplomat, some tourist. to store up favors so if there is a time when we need help. I have powerful people I can call upon. But Victor was a good neighbor. He is not family. Family is all that matters. Please, please. leave these things to my good judgment. This assignment is bullshit. Come on. A few days in a nice hotel. no one shooting at us? Gentlemen, welcome I am Paul Rusesabagina. the house manager. - How you doing? - Nice to meet you. Anything that you need. please find me. - Thank you. - Certainly. So, what is the actual difference According to the Belgian colonists. the Tutsis are taller and more elegant. It was the Belgians that created the division. How? They picked people. those with thinner noses, lighter skin. They used to measure the width of people\\'s noses. The Belgians used the Tutsis to run the country. Then when they left. they left the power to the Hutus. and of course the Hutus took revenge on the elite Tutsis for years of repression. Am I telling the truth, Paul? Yes, unfortunately. Please take this to the general. Benedict is our finest journalist in Kigali, an expert on the subject. So what are you, Paul? I am Hutu. Gentlemen. - More champagne? - More champagne would be nice. Excuse me, honey. Can I ask you a personal question? - Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi? - I am Tutsi. - And your friend? Tutsi? - No, I am Hutu. They could be twins. Get the camera. The general\\'s going to give us an interview. Okay. I\\'m in room 22, I\\'d love to finish up this conversation. Senior U.N. officers claim that the Rwandan army is secretly training and arming the Hutu militia called the Interhamwe. I put this claim to the head of the armed forces, General Bizimungu. No. No, we have not been training the militia. The U. N. are mistaken in this accusation. Do you support your president\\'s agreement to make peace with the rebels? The president has the full support of the army. That peace agreement will be signed today in Tanzania between Tutsi rebel forces and President Habyarimana. This is a great day for Rwanda and for all of Africa. Negotiation has replaced confrontation... Paul, have a drink. Friendship has replaced fear. Ladies and gentlemen. we have a live feed to the signing of the peace agreement. To our president. May he find peace. May we all find peace. Let us all dedicate ourselves to nurturing this hard-earned accord. To peace! Peace! - Look me up if you come over. - Yes, it is a beautiful city. I am planning on returning there as-- Forgive me. - Thank you. Bye. - Thomas. - Hello, Fedens. Well, this is a surprise. Forgive us, Paul. We must talk. Yes, what\\'s wrong? I have it from a very reliable source, Paul. Who? Thank you, Sullivan. My assistant. the Hutu Power man. He says that we must get out now. that soon it\\'ll be very bad. Give me this man\\'s name. Please, Paul, even though he is Interhamwe, he\\'s a friend. He wants your job, Thomas. He said that there is a signal. It is \"Cut the tall trees,\" And when they hear this signal. the militia are to go to war. Paul, please, let us take Tatiana with us. You are Hutu. You will be safe. Fedens, I know you have heard many things. And I know what we have seen, Thomas. But please, the United Nations are here now. The world press are watching. The peace has been signed. Let this process work-- What was that? Power cuts. We are running on generators. Fedens... Please, don\\'t worry. Tomorrow you will come by the house and we will discuss this with Tatiana. All right? - Good night, Paul. - Yes. Kiss the girls for me. Shit! Stay in your houses. Stay in your house. Everybody stay in your house! Tatiana? - Paul! - Tatiana! - What is going on here? - Our house has been burned. - Didn\\'t you hear the news? - What news? They are saying President Habyarimana has been murdered. Tutsi rebels have killed him. Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace? Everyone, please. out of this room. Please. Jean Baptiste, find them seats in the other room. Odette, please. - Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens? - Yes, I told them to go home. - Go and call them, Tatsi. - Why do the neighbors run to us? - You are the only Hutu they can trust. You are a Tutsi. They are scared, Paul. I am scared. These are probably rumors started by agitators. We must remain calm for the children, Tatsi. We must. Forgive me, Paul. Elys says that Roger has gone. Gone? Gone where? - He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama. He went next door. Wait, Paul! Tatiana, no, You have to - Stay in the house, No! - Please. Paul, please, what is wrong? Tell me, what is wrong? - Oh, my son! Where are you hurt? - Is he okay? Oh, my baby! Talk to me. Where are you hurt? Paul? Oh, Tatsi. Odette, Odette! Oh, no. I\\'m okay. Get his clothes off. Tatsi, please get some water. - He\\'s hurt. - Please, let\\'s get his clothes off. - He\\'s covered in blood. - Lay back, son. He went next door to the Chirangas. Where is he hurt? Look here, Odette, look here. Stay still, Roger. Keep him still, Paul. - I can\\'t find the wound. - What happened to you? - Tell your mother. - Talk to me. Tell your mother what happened, Roger. Roger, you\\'re okay. Do not worry, he is not cut. He is not hurt. This is not his blood, Paul. You are not hurt. My darling, it\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. You are safe. Look at your mother. Come here, Elys. - Where did the blood come from? - Please, please! - You are safe. - You are out, Roger. You are safe, you are safe, Roger. You are safe, Roger. It\\'s okay. I love you so much. I love you. Oh, son. Paul. Listen to me, good people of Rwanda. Terrible news... - It is true. - Horrible news... Our great president is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches. Oh, my God! They tricked him to sign their phony peace agreement. Then they shot his plane from the sky. It is time to clear the brush. good Hutus of Rwanda. We must cut the tall trees. cut the tall trees now! The soldiers are here! - Let us go to work, loyal Hutus. - No, no. Everyone, stay calm. Stay calm and be quiet. Find these traitors. Let none of them escape. Split up. Everybody out. - You two, check the back. - You, go and find him. - Yes, sir. I better go have a word with them.

There are Tutsi spies everywhere. I cannot take all these people. No, no, sir. We have our car and our van. - Captain Kaliso, come on. - Roger. - Let\\'s go! - Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around. We found him. Let\\'s go. Let\\'s go! - Can I go with you? - Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry. Oh, Jesus, no! Oh, it\\'s Simon, Papa!

Why not take some money for your work? - How much? - You name a price. 10,000 francs for each. - Sir, I don\\'t have that much. Wait, wait! Here. It\\'s 1,000 U,S. 50,000 francs for my wife and children. - Take them. - Go, go, go. Go, go, go. - Have you any money? - Nothing. - Paul, don\\'t let them die. Sir, I have more money actually.

We are trying to get as much information for you as we can. - And yes, your passport, yes. - And my passport. Antoinette will take care of this for you. Dube, where is Gregoire? Sir, he has moved Mr. Manager. What do you think you are doing, Gregoire? Who is it? It\\'s okay, darling. What do you want? You had better get out of this room and back downstairs right away. - I don\\'t have to listen to you anymore. - Yes, you do. I am in charge. Now get out of this room right now. Mr. Manager, do you notice the smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room. And I know people who can cleanse it. But maybe it doesn\\'t bother you. Why is that? Are you used to the smell? Well, not me. I need a clean room to escape it. Please move into the hotel. Everyone, keep moving. My house has been burned. I have nowhere to go. Yes, I understand this, Your Honor. But we are operating at capacity as it is. I can give you one room. but you will have to share it, I\\'m sorry. - There\\'s no way we can share. - I am sorry. Forgive me. There are eight of us. - Yes? - Paul, I need your help. Yes, Madame Archer. They\\'re Tutsi children from the St. Francis orphanage. Okay, come on, let\\'s go. - I have only one room. - That\\'ll do.

Can you please get them and bring them here to me? - Sure. - And I have a photo. Please, keep moving! - Thanks, Paul. Please move into the hotel! Come on, kids, don\\'t be afraid. - Take them around the back. - Everyone, keep moving! Has he spoken to you yet? No. Is your face still hurting? It\\'s all right. The neighbors asked me to thank you for your kindness. I shouldn\\'t have brought them here. The first thing they told me when I received my appointment was to never, never lower \"Maintain the Mille Collines\\' dignity at all times, Paul,\" Soon all of this will be over. What if I lose my job, Tatsi? Oh, my God! - Where are you going? - I\\'ll be right back. Take care of them. How, sir? Bathe them, feed them. Put them to bed. I will send you some help. Okay, babies. We have heard reports of reprisal massacres. Will the U.N. intervene to stop the bloodshed? We\\'re here as peacekeepers. not as peacemakers. My orders are not to intervene. - Excuse me. - Thank you, Colonel. Here. Over here. Listen, I got us a car. but we gotta move now. We\\'re not allowed to do that, Jack. David, the shit\\'s going down outside these walls. We gotta cover it. We\\'re not leaving the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. - That\\'s the ground rules. - The ground rules? Where do you think we are. fucking Wimbledon? We cover the story from here until we get the proper vehicles, Jack. Shoot some \"B\" roll of the refugees. Let\\'s go. Colonel, I have no way to protect these people. And I have more refugees than I have room for as it is. I was given 20 orphans today by the Red Cross. This is not a refugee camp. Can you not take them with you to your facilities? No, I can\\'t do that, Paul. I\\'m overwhelmed at my refugee camp. I\\'m under attack, constant attack. As soon as we can stabilize this situation, then I\\'ll take \\'em. ...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches who try to run from justice. The Tutsi cockroach judge called Makesa is hiding at 4... -... Kabulla and his cockroaches... - Turn that radio off. Watch out for him. He-- And get back to work. We have a hotel to run. There\\'s no work here anyway. The boss has left. I am your boss! Sir, there\\'s a call from the Mille collines in Rwanda on line one. Yes? Who am I speaking to? Yes, sir. Paul Rusesabagina. the house manager. I met you on your last visit here. Mr. Tillens. Ah, yes, Paul. I remember. How are things there? The situation is difficult, sir. Some of our directors believe we should close the Mille Collines until this unrest is over. I\\'m not sure about that, Paul. What do you think? Sir, that would be The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers. What would they think if Sabena deserted them now? I assure you, the United Nations have everything under control, sir. Very well, Paul. Very well. But if this thing gets worse. we must close. If there is anything I can do, please call. Sir, yes, there is one thing I\\'m going to be needing from you right away. Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment for me to have to ask for this. Most of us in this room have known each other and worked together for many years. Is it really necessary for me to get a letter from Belgium for you to perform your duties? In fact, forget this letter. If you don\\'t want to work for me and would rather be out there, then leave now. Please, everyone, back to work. Paul, thank you for coming. The air conditioner\\'s on the blink. Is there any way you can have a look at it? - I\\'m just on a deadline. - Certainly. Fred, let me know when you get the satellite feed. Thanks. Mr. Fleming, I brought you some tea as well, sir. Thank you, Paul. You\\'re an oasis in the desert. ...the elements of the government and army are following the example of what happened to the Americans in Somalia. I think they intend to intimidate us. try to attack us, and... hope that the West will pull all its troops out. - Do you think they\\'ll succeed? - No, they won \\'t. The U. N. \\'s here to stay. What about the outbreak of violence since the shooting down of the president\\'s plane? What the hell do you think you\\'re doing? I\\'m responsible for the safety of this crew. What is this? - Where did you get this? - Half a mile down the road. Fred, it\\'s David. I\\'ve got incredible footage. It\\'s a massacre. Dead bodies, machetes. If I get this through right away. can you make the evening news? Yeah. You have to lead with this. I point at you, you do a shot. And you\\'ll get a total double and see if all the drinking-- - Excuse me, Mr. Daglish. - Hey, Paul. Listen, sorry about earlier. If I\\'d known you were in there. I wouldn\\'t have-- I am glad that you have shot this footage and that the world will see it. It is the only way we have a chance that people might intervene. Yeah, and if no one intervenes. How can they not intervene when they witness such atrocities? I think if people see this footage... ...they\\'ll say, \"Oh, my God. that\\'s horrible,\" and then go on eating their dinners. What the hell do I know? Listen, you wanna just relax? I have more work to do. I thank you for your offer. Please enjoy your evening. Mr. Daglish. - Help! Please help us! Please! - Sir! Sir! We\\'ve got trouble at the gate. Can we have some medical assistance here, please? That group, come with me. Move out of the area. - Here, get up, get up. - Right, fall back, everybody. Benedict, what is happening? They\\'re killing everyone. The lady... The Interhamwe have surrounded the whole town. Come on! Cover the road. Now. Stand your ground. Hold the line. Do not shoot! Do not shoot! - Lieutenant, guard this gate. - Yes, sir. You two, take up positions behind those sandbags. They murdered my men. I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers. They were protecting the lady prime minister. - She is dead? - Yeah, she\\'s dead. The Europeans are putting together an intervention force. They\\'ll be here in a few days. I understand that, Colonel, but there is What can I do? I\\'ll put two more men on the gate. two of my best lieutenants. - All right. - All right. I understand. Thank you. Madame Archer. Hello. - We were expecting you five days ago. - I\\'m sorry. My brother and his family. did you find them? I made it to the house. - Empty? - It had been ransacked. As I left, an old woman. I went to the house. She has the two little girls. They\\'re safe. Okay. But... My brother and his wife-- did the old lady know of them? My brother is dead. They would never leave their children. Perhaps they could not make it home, Tatiana. They are hiding. Please, can you return and bring the girls back here to us? I can\\'t. There are Interhamwe roadblocks everywhere. When I reached the orphanage... the Interhamwe were there. They\\'d already started killing children. They made me watch. There was one girl. she had her little sister wrapped on her back. As they were about to chop her. she cried out to me. \"Please don\\'t let them kill me. I promise I won\\'t be Tutsi anymore,\" Please, I can\\'t. They\\'re targeting Tutsi children, Paul. to wipe out the next generation. I\\'ve nowhere to take the orphans, Paul. Don\\'t worry. There will be an intervention force coming soon. We will get the orphans out then. They\\'re here! They\\'re here! We are safe! Soldiers have arrived! - Wow, look, it\\'s the French! Thank goodness! - Welcome. - Thank you. Well done. About time, gentlemen. Thank you for saving our lives. It\\'s okay, Roger. Jean Baptiste, our prayers have been answered. Thank God. Yes, finally! See, it\\'s okay. We can do nothing from our side. Sweetheart, I told you we\\'d be safe. See? I told you. Yeah. So, Colonel, what can I get for you? Something strong. - Scotch? - Yeah. Congratulations, Colonel. You have performed a minor miracle. - Congratulations, huh? - Yes, sir. You should spit in my face. Excuse me, Colonel? You\\'re dirt. We think you\\'re dirt, Paul. Who is \"we\"? The West, all the superpowers. everything you believe in, Paul. They think you\\'re dirt. they think you\\'re dung. You\\'re worthless. I\\'m afraid I don\\'t understand what you are saying, sir. Come on, don\\'t bullshit me, Paul. You\\'re the smartest man here. You got them all eating out of your hands. You could own this freakin\\' hotel. you\\'re black. You\\'re not even a nigger. You\\'re an African. They\\'re not gonna stay, Paul. They\\'re not gonna stop this slaughter. Please. Got it. - Hello. - Hello, Daddy. Elys, take Diane in the other room. What is it? All the whites are leaving. They are being evacuated. But\\x85 what about us? We have been abandoned. But the soldiers will stop the killers. Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen. I said all the whites are leaving-- the French, the Italians. even the U.N. Belgian soldiers. all of them! Who is left? I don\\'t know. Colonel Oliver said he has 300 U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country. The most he can spare for the hotel are four men. And they are not allowed to shoot. I am a fool. No. No, no. They told me I was one of them, and I... Wine, chocolates, cigars, style-- I swallowed it. I swallowed it. I swallowed all of it. And they handed me their shit. I have no history. I have no memory. I\\'m a fool, Tatsi. You are no fool. I know who you are. News Service Africa. A United Nations source reports that the U. S. and British representatives on the Security council will lobby for the removal of all U.N. peacekeepers from Rwanda. Please, Jack. Wait, he\\'s British. Jack, please don\\'t leave me. Can we talk? Just one second. Please, Jack. Please. They\\'ll put me on the street. They\\'ll chop me. Here. Now just take... - Take this. - No, no... Just take the money. Please, just take the money. You must go. You must. Please, they are waiting. - Paul! - They are waiting. Paul. He won\\'t put you out. Here, give her anything she wants. - Anything. Just charge it. - This is not necessary. - They\\'re gonna kill us here. - Let him go. We have to let him go. Don\\'t do that, please. Jesus Christ, I\\'m so ashamed. Wait! Wait! Hold the buses! Peter! Thank you for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you. - No Rwandans. - What? Foreign nationals only. Sorry, Father, those were the orders. - But you can\\'t leave the children behind. - Sorry, Father, we have our orders. - You can\\'t leave them! - We can do no more. Father, it is of no use. These men are not here-- They are not here to help us. Please, there is nothing we can do. Get your people on the bus. I will take care of the others. It is of no use, Father. No, no, no. To the hotel. To the hotel. Sir, please, don\\'t touch the camera. We have the right to film. - No filming. - Go to the hotel. Go inside. Go inside the hotel. Yes, you can stay, yes. We will take care of you. Go into the hotel. No! Go to the hotel. Go inside. Go inside the hotel. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Sir. - Come, Dube. - Please, everyone inside. - Please, people, let\\'s go inside. Out of the rain, please. Come, sister, come. Paul. I want you to go. Go where? You take the children. You go get the girls. - Your card says Hutu-- - What are you saying? Please, please. You pay money at the roadblocks. I want you to go. No, Tatiana, no. I will never leave you. I will never leave you. Oh, Tatsi. Let us sleep, my wife. Let us sleep. Get up. Get up. Get up, get up, get up. - Are you the manager? - Yes, sir. What\\'s the matter? Everyone must leave the hotel now. - Why? - Papa, what\\'s wrong? It\\'s an order. I need some time-- 20, 30 minutes--to take a shower. - Sir, people are still sleeping. - I don\\'t care. Please, let me get you some beers. You and your boys. And I\\'ll be down right away, all right? As quick as I can. - Ten minutes. - Yes, sir, ten minutes. - Get out of the way. - Quick, children, quickly. - Roger\\'s not here. - Where is he? Where\\'s Roger? Under the bed. Roger. It\\'s Papa. They\\'ve gone. They\\'ve gone, they\\'ve gone. Come, come. Come on. Oh, my darling. It\\'s okay, sweetie. It\\'s okay. Come on, it\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. - Go to the roof, Tatiana. Yes, yes. go to the roof right now. Yes, good day. General Bizimungu, please. He is where? No, that is unacceptable. Who would order such a thing? Yes, did you find the general? Gentlemen, please have some beer. Get me the guest list. Yes, sir. Yes? Sorry, sir, but I have a call from Paul in Kigali. He says it\\'s urgent. Paul, are you all right? We have a big problem, sir. What? The Hutu army have come. They\\'ve ordered us-- all of us--out of the hotel. Why are they doing this? I think they will kill us all. Kill? What do you mean\\x85 all? How many? We have 100 staff and now more than 800 guests. - 800?! - Yes, sir. There are now 800 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. I do not have much time left, sir. I want to thank you for everything that you have done for me and my family. and please thank all of my friends at Sabena. Paul, wait. I\\'m gonna put you on hold. Stay by the phone. - Where are your papers? - We don\\'t have any papers, sir. We don\\'t have any papers. They got burnt in the house. Louis, get on to the U.N. Tell them what\\'s happening. Did you need something, sir? Mary, call the prime minister\\'s office. Tell them I must speak with him now. Okay. Paul, are you there? Yes, sir. Who can I call to stop this? The French. They supply the Hutu army. Do everything you can to buy time. I\\'ll call you right back. What are you doing, Dube? The lieutenant, sir. - Go and get these boys some more beer. - Thirsty, boy? You like beer? Thank you. Come with me, please. Sir, that was two weeks ago. Here you are, sir. Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier... What is this? It is the guest list, sir. Are you trying to make a fool of me? No. We stopped taking names after the president was murdered. - This is the only guest list, sir. - There are no Europeans left! Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there now. - That will take time. - We don\\'t have time. If I don\\'t have the names so that I can pick out the traitors. then I\\'ll kill everyone in there. Starting with you. Leave. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Who did you call? - Who did I call? - Don\\'t lie to me! What is your name? Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina. I\\'ll remember you. I\\'ll remember you. - Let\\'s go. - Come on, we\\'re leaving. They\\'ve gone. Paul, Paul. I was afraid for you. Sir, the president of Sabena is on the phone for you. I must talk with this man. - Mr. Tillens. - Paul, what\\'s going on? They left. Thank you, sir. What did you do? I got through to the French president\\'s office. Well, thank you. You have saved our lives. I pleaded with the French and the Belgians to go back and get you all. I am afraid this is not going to happen. They\\'re cowards, Paul. Rwanda is not worth a single vote to any of them. The French, the British. I am sorry, Paul. Thank you. There will be no rescue... ...no intervention for us. We can only save ourselves. Many of you know influential people abroad. You must call these people. Please, fax this You must tell them what will happen to us. Say good-bye. But when you say good-bye. say it as though you are reaching through the phone and holding their hand. Let them know that if they let go of that hand... ...you will die. We must shame them into sending help. Most importantly. this cannot be a refugee camp. The Interhamwe believe that the Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel. That is the only thing that is keeping us alive. Have you printed the bills? Thank you. Now please erase the register. - Erase it? - Yes, I want no names to appear there. Boss, the carpenters are ready. Tell them to remove all of the numbers from the doors. - And put what? - And put nothing. Good day. Here is your bill for the last week. If you cannot pay or think you will not be able to pay. please go to the banquet room and Dube will take care of you. Thank you. Does the State Department have a view as to whether or not what is happening could be genocide? We have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred. How many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide? Alan, that\\'s just not a question that I\\'m in a position to answer. Is it true that you have specific guidance not to use the word \"genocide\" in isolation. but always to preface it with this word \"acts of\"? I have guidance which I try to use as best as I can. I have-- There are formulations that we are using that we are trying to be consistent in our use of-- I\\'m sorry it is not Glenmorangie. As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you. - So it would seem. - Well, don\\'t worry. - I will take care of you. - I\\'m glad to hear that because I was wondering if perhaps you could spare us a few policemen. To protect us, sir. - The police are very busy, Paul. - Yes, I\\'m aware of this. But when I last spoke to the president of Sabena. he assured me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be well rewarded. I will see what I can do. Excuse me momentarily, sir. Where has all our beer gone? Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer. How much beer? Many. ...come down to the reception. And then he says to me. \"How do you want the girls?\" There\\'s our cockroach manager. Always kissing ass. General... I\\'m glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. What did you overhear? It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel and an American Embassy official. And what did they say? The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything. How? They have gone, Paul. With their spies. Satellites. Americans. Oh, Gregoire! You know, I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amid such madness? - I am a strong man, Paul. - I wish I were more like you. - I mean, look at my staff. - Cheers. He won\\'t work. - He is staff? - Oh, yes. Yes. Get back to work, you slug! Go! Satellites? What was I going to say, that the Americans were hiding in the trees? - What\\'s the matter? - I have to go out and get food. - Go out? Where? - To George Rutaganda\\'s place. No. No, no. I have to, Tatiana. We are only as valuable as the money we give to him. You cannot go alone. I\\'m not going alone. I\\'ll take Gregoire with me. He\\'s a good Hutu. and he wants to impress me now. It is good to see you back at work, Gregoire. - Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies. - Please, please. We have a job this morning. We are going to see George Rutaganda. Please get the van. Show me your I.D. Remember how those Tutsi women used to look down their long noses at Hutu men? Now they beg for their lives. I\\'m here to see my friend George Rutaganda. I say taste those Tutsi whores before they die. Then they\\'ll know what Hutu power is, my warriors. Remember, one cockroach can start an infestation. We need to exterminate these vermin. Hey, Paul, my old friend. Tutsi prostitutes and witches. So, what can I do for you? - I need supplies, George. - Anytime. Paul, everything is double the price now. You understand that? Yes, I need rice, beans. powdered milk, beer. and your best whiskey. Beer yes, but whiskey no. You have no whiskey? No whiskey, no spirits. Your\\x85 rich guests will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, Paul. I have bled that cow enough now. What are you saying, George? Your rich cockroaches at the hotel. Soon all the Tutsis will be dead. You do not honestly believe that you can kill them all? And why not? Why not? We are halfway there already. So, Paul, you want 12 bags of rice? Give him 12 bags of rice and 4 crates of beer. Yes, sir, right away. Oh, and, Paul. I\\'ll give you a crate of soft drinks for the kids free of charge. Yes. Ten bags of beans. Come, quick. And put those in the van. You. Let me give you a little tip, my friend. Our generals in army say. \"Don\\'t go near the Mille Collines or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here,\" But soon those generals will have gone and we will be in charge. It\\'s time to butcher that fat cow of yours for the meat. Let\\'s go. Maybe you could help us, Paul. You have some very important traitors at that hotel. Now, if we were to get them. then maybe we would let you have one or two cockroaches of your own. Do you understand? It is almost dawn, George. We really must be going. Take the river road back. It\\'s clear. - Gregoire. - What is going on now? - You\\'ve driven off the road. - No, I\\'m on the road. You\\'re going to put us in the river. Stop the car, stop the car. Back up the car, Gregoire. Listen to me. You will tell no one what you have seen here today. No one, Gregoire. Dube. Please help Gregoire to unload the van. Thank you. Oh, dear. Oh, God! Oh, God! - Sir. - Dube! - Sir, are you okay? - Don\\'t come in. Don\\'t come in. I\\'ll be out in a minute. - Sir, are you okay? - Yes, I\\'m all right, Dube. Don\\'t come in, I\\'ll be out. Hundreds. It was too many to count. Why are people so cruel? Hatred. Insanity, I don\\'t know. There you go. Is she putting her fingers in the soup? Oh, yes. to do with you. Nothing to do with me. I remember... No, no, no, you make a mistake. - Hello. - Come with me. - Where are we going? - Just come. It\\'s beautiful. You like it? I hear we must pay for everything. Yes, this is true. So\\x85 how much for this? A kiss. You are a good man. Paul Rusesabagina. I have a confession. When you worked as the nurse... - In Ruhengeri? - Yes. When we first met... I had you transferred to Kigali. What? I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali. - Why? - To be closer. So that I could marry you. What was the bribe? - What am I worth to you? - It was substantial. - Tell me what it was. - A car. - What sort of car? - What does that matter? I want to know. A Volkswagen. I hope it was a new one. We have had a good life. you and I. Yes. I thank God every day for the time we\\'ve had. - We have to have a plan. - A plan? Our children cannot see us die first. If the militia come, you must come up here as quick as you can. - Please, I don\\'t want to-- - I don\\'t want you to talk like this, please. - We have to, Tatiana. If I do not make it. you must take all of our children by the hand... and you must jump. - What are you saying? I could never-- - You have to, Tatiana. - You have to promise me. - What are you saying? Tatiana, the machete is no way to die. You have to promise me you will do it. I cannot do-- You have to promise me, Tatiana. Please. Promise me you will do it. Please, Tatiana. Yes. I\\'m sorry. I love you. I love you. I\\'m gonna get you! Diane, Elys, you know better. No one can be at the front of the hotel, I have told you this. - Take these children in the back. Hurry. - Sorry, Papa. - Come, children. Come. Paul, I\\'ve got good news. Congratulations. Your calls have worked. I have exit visas for the following families. Abukesu, Tanzania. Bidori, Kenya. Gituaranga, Zambia. Hallelujah! Khalesa, Belgium. Oh, thank you! Dakuzi... Kenya. Masambo, Zambia. Zinguru, Ghana. Rusesabagina, Belgium. All right, that\\'s it. So remember. Let\\'s go. - Colonel? - Yeah. Now, certainly Odette and Jean Baptiste are on the list. I\\'m sorry, Jean, Odette. But I have been assured there will be another plane soon. Excuse me. Don\\'t worry, Tatsi. we\\'ll make it to the next list. Yeah. The girls-- Paul, I will not leave without them. What have you brought us? Antibiotics, medical supplies. general first aid. Thank you. - I hear there\\'s to be a convoy. - Yes. Are you on the list? Madame Archer, I have Is there any way that you could return to the old woman and bring the girls back here to us? Paul, that side of town has been They\\'re probably dead. Madame Archer, I\\'m begging you. Those girls have no one now. I\\'ll try. We have to leave by 7 a.m. Who\\'ll take care of the orphans when you\\'re gone? Odette, Odette will care for them until we can get them out of here. Tell me, Paul, what country\\'s gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans? I will find someone. I promise you. - Thanks. - Thank you. Come on, take my hand. News Service Africa. Today a Red cross representative claimed that the death rate in the Rwandan conflict may have climbed to as many as 500,000 victims. One report stated that 40,000 bodies had been removed from Lake Victoria. Where is she? I don\\'t know. We wait until seven. If she is not back with the girls by then... ...she may not be coming.

Your father\\'s going to be okay. Papa! - Don\\'t worry. He\\'s okay. - I want Papa! It\\'s okay. I say those Hutus who shelter the cockroaches are the same as cockroaches. - They are all the same. - This is crazy. Their fate should be the same. This is RTLM. The Tutsi cockroaches of the rebel army must be denied recruits. come on, good Hutus. The graves are not yet full. - Who will help us fill them? - That goddamn radio station. Okay. Yeah, they are going to the airport. Stand by your radios. I am hearing some urgent news. - Boss! Please, come quick! - Not now, Dube. It is important! It is on the radio. You have to hear it. We have received reports of very important cockroaches and traitors trying to escape from the Mille collines Hotel. Gather up your weapons. Stand by your radios. We will keep you informed. - They are being smuggled away... - No, no! Who told them of this, Dube? I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire. I saw him leaving in our bus. Please, sir. I say who leaves that hotel. and no one else. General Bizimungu. they are driving into an ambush. Slow down. Stay calm. - What is happening? - We\\'re stopping. You have got cockroaches in these trucks. No, no. I\\'ve got U.N. personnel in these trucks. I\\'ve got permission to go through these roadblocks. - I\\'m going to search these trucks. - You are not going to search this convoy. - I am. - Cover me. Go to the back. Get away from that truck. Get away from that truck! Now! Get back! You\\'re not to hurt these people. Get back! Move back! Look, I told you. you\\'ve got cockroaches in your truck. No, no, no.

You have nothing, and yet you call me, begging me for help? Do you know the trouble I have protecting these cockroaches? Sir, I have money from the guests. Rwandan francs! Those are only good for wiping your ass. There is nothing more I can do for you, Paul. No more police. no more protection. Let the U.N. take care of you. Drive. Go! What would Sabena make of this? Watch out! Get down, get down! Are you hurt? Go outside. Please stay still. There\\'s glass here, I will get it out. Is anyone hurt, Odette? Lots of cuts and bruises. Thank God it was a storeroom. And in Rwanda. humanitarian agencies report that a rapid advance by the Tutsi rebel army has sparked a mass evacuation of Hutu refugees towards the Congo. One aid worker described it as the largest refugee exodus in modern history. The rebels have taken half the city. and they have proposed a deal the Hutu generals are willing to accept. The rebels will exchange their Hutu prisoners. and you people. all of you. will be able to move behind the rebel lines where it\\'s safe. The Interhamwe, what about them? - No one controls them. - This time they will kill us all. They will kill us all if we stay here. We have to take the chance. What time should we be ready to leave? I can put it together in two days, Paul. Two days? Colonel, there is no way that we can hold out for two days. I have nothing left to bribe them with. Colonel, we will Diane\\x85 let your mother rest. You rest too, sweetheart. Diplomat. What? I have to go to the Diplomat. - What are you doing? - We have to go to the Diplomat. - To do what? - Your items, they are there. Will you please put your policemen at the gate, sir? No. Let us see what you have to offer first. Oh, no, Madame Archer. Move, move! - Cover us. - Yes, sir. Hurry! Come on, show me. Look at this. Nice, yes? And here you are. The rebels are getting closer, yes? The rebels can have this graveyard. We have ordered everyone out of the city. Here. Have a drink. You know what the Scottish call it? No. Uisge beatha--water of life. I went once on a tour of the finest single malt distillery in the world. - Have you ever been to Scotland? - No, sir. Wonderful country. Wonderful golf. I wonder, will I ever go back? What do you think? No. I hope we all get to do a great many things, General. Can we go now. please, sir?

I do not want to go to Gitarama, sir. Well, you can\\'t go back to the hotel. The crazy men are on their way there now. Sir\\x85 General, we must go back so that I can get my family. Trust me. General, these are difficult times. We need to help one another. And what help can I get from you, Paul? You are a marked man, sir. You are on a list. The Americans have you on their list as a war criminal. Paul, I am sick and tired Are you stupid, General? How do you think these people operate? You sit here with five stars on your chest. Who do you think they are coming after? Fine. We will go to Gitarama. and you will stay on that list. - I committed no war crimes. - Who will tell them? You need me to tell them how you helped at the hotel. They blame you for all their misfortunes. They say you led the massacres. I led no massacres! Do you think they\\'re going to believe you? You will tell them the truth! I will tell them nothing unless you help me. What are you going to do. shoot me? Shoot me. Please shoot me. It would be a blessing. I will pay you to shoot my family.

Paul! Matea! -A hundred? -That's right. By strange coincidence, that's exactly what l sell a painting for... to a friend, of course. A dealer would charge you ten times more. You'll be back when? About a month? The way l plan to work, there'll be over a dozen for you to chose from. ln cash. Right. Well... the trouble is, at this moment, l do not have any. Ask anyone in the South Seas, Charles Arnaud always collects his debts... ...especially from his friends. -Right. Wallet. lf you don't mind waiting, l have some money coming in from Paris. Alright, l'll wait. lt's a nice-looking piece. May l? -Did you think that was empty? -l did, as a matter of fact. You'll get to know me. -Would you like to give a hundred? -What? -To tide me over. -You've got a bloody cheek. You will get to know me. Schuff. Pick a share. -What? -Pick a share. -Alright, Consolidated Railways. -You've been plunging in those. -Hardly plunging. -How many have you got? l don't know. A few thousand. 200 says l can trade up the price of Consolidated Railways by at least... 3 francs. lf l fail, l pay you 200. lf l succeed, you pay me... but your loss is covered by the rise in the share price. Are you on? -Two hundred? -0h, for God's sake, Schuff. This is perfect for a tidy little profit. No risk. -Alright. -Good. Buy a lot of Consolidated Railway at 68 francs. At my signal. -Sell all our Consolidated Railways. -Are you sure? Go. Schuffenecker. -Monsieur Bertin. -Not at your desk? -Good morning M. Bertin. -Gauguin. -We have conducted an experiment. -lndeed? l'd be glad to see you both at your desks. Pompous ass. When l think of the money l've made for him. Speaking of money, Schuff, we're up five. l don't believe you had anything to do with it. lt was coincidence. Be careful, Schuff, or l'll trade them back down tomorrow. -Hey, mister. Want to try some? -l used to love to juggle. You still do, with figures. What... -But... -Stop that boy! -l'm sorry. This is my fault. -Why can't you look where you go? l just had my pocket picked. Are you hurt? There doesn't seem to be any damage. -ls this your work? -Yes. -You're Pissarro. -You have the advantage of me. l'm sorry, we've never met. l know your work. l'm a collector. Paul Gauguin. -ls it for sale? -l've been trying to sell it. What are you asking? Would you take two hundred? -Two hundred? Are you serious? -Perfectly. -l was only asking fifty. -You're too honest. -Not at all. l'd have taken twenty. -Well, it's too late. l do not have my wallet. Please, take my card. Come any evening, after six. -Please, take it. -Are you sure? Who'd want to steal a Pissarro? l wish somebody would. -lt'd be a sign of success. -l think it's beautiful. Mette. -Not another one. -What do you think? Ghastly. Still it matches all the others, l suppose. That's something. You have no taste. -l have impeccable taste. -Yes, in men. But in art, you are a barbarian. Papa! Can l have a puppy, please? l'll feed him and l'll walk him! l promise. Please? When you're older, Aline. -But Jean-Rene is older. He'll help. -lt's your idea, Aline. -Please, Papa. -When you are older. lt's not fair, l shall sulk. -l'd rather have sulks than a puppy. -l agree. Monsieur Gauguin! -Good day to you. -Good day. -l am Father Maurrin. -My new landlord. How do you do? Well, well. Come. This way. Not much of a place, l'm afraid. As my colleague in Papeete may have told you... l had it built for the master of the mission school. Unfortunately, l had to dismiss the man. Yes, so l gather. -Why? -He went native. Still... if it suits you... -Perfectly. -Good. Good. -Then, if l could have the rent... -Yes, the rent. l was hoping we could come to some kind of an arrangement about that. What kind of arrangement? l was thinking maybe you would like one of my paintings in lieu. l'm afraid that's quite out of the question. Father Pierre was quite clear in his letter to me. He said you'd agreed to pay half-yearly in advance. ln cash. l did, but unfortunately, l find myself rather short at this moment. -l see. -lf you'd be so kind as to wait... l don't appear to have any choice... but it is most unsatisfactory. l shall have to charge interest on the outstanding amount. Sunday mass is at 1 0 o'clock. l'm sorry, madam never buys at the door. But monsieur does. Come on in. Thank you. That's fine, Suzanne. Thank you. You are a collector. -May l? -Yes. Thank you. This is astonishing. Astonishing. l'll take it. Same price as before. Yes, yes, of course. Your own work. You paint. -l dabble. -How long have you been painting? l have been dabbling for a few years. You mean you've had no formal training? -No, none at all. -What you've done is remarkable. You have a rare, natural talent. -You do not need to flatter me. -l have devoted my life to painting. lf l thought this was rubbish l'd preserve a discreet silence. -l don't think this is rubbish. -Really? lt's good. lt's very good. Hello. Where have you sprung from? -l'll be your vahine. -Vahine? You want to live here and cook, and take care of this house? What is your name? -Tehura. -My name is Paul. Everybody call you ''tatavahine''. ''Man-woman''. Why would they call me that? Well... your hair. And what do you think? Do you think l'm a man or a woman? Man. Cheer up, you lot. We're almost there. They didn't want to come, you know. -l did. -You would say that. l don't know why we all have to be dragged down to lunch with them. ln one or two years, you'll be dropping his name all over Paris. Now smile. There you go. -They're here. Did you get coffee? -How many times must l tell you, yes? -And cream. What about cream? -How am l to find money for cream? They must take us as they find us. Children, come along. Remember, behave. -Pissarro! -You found us, then. -Welcome to Pontoise. Come along. -This is Clovis. -Hello, Clovis. Monsieur. -Hello. -Madame. Delighted to meet you. -Mette. -This is Aline. -My wife, Lucy. How do you do? -Hello. -Hello. -Monsieur Gauguin. -Nice to meet you. Lucy, why don't you take Madame Gauguin inside? l've already prepared lunch. Nothing fancy... but l think you'll find there is enough to go around. l'm sure there is. lt's just that we're rather a tribe. We didn't want to eat you out of house and home. Just because your husband has bought a few paintings... it doesn't mean you can patronize us. l'm so sorry. l was thoughtless. The last thing we wanted to do was to offend you. Paul admires your husband's paintings enormously. 0h, dear! 0h, dear, what is it? -Come on! -Pull! l've never expected much. l don't need much. But Camille... he's such a proud man! lt's terrible for him to see his children in hand-me-down clothing. Going hungry. His family was quite well to do, you know. He can't make a living. Maybe if he painted in a more conventional style... That's exactly what l say! l've told him a hundred times. He is too advanced. The public don't understand. We nearly got them! Pull! Pull! They pity me, you know? People in the street. l can see it in their eyes. Well, l pity them. ln their hearts, they hate the littleness of their lives. -But they're trapped. -0ff we go. l love my life. But then, what the hell does money mean? Nothing. A man makes a fortune, the world calls him a great man. He dies... the world forgets him. But the artist? No, no. The artist touches the soul of the world and transforms it. And the world remembers. Now that's greatness. Now we've made it! <i>But then</i>, <i>what the hell</i> <i>does money mean?</i> <i>The artist touches the soul</i> <i>of the world and transforms it</i>. <i>And the world remembers</i>. <i>That's greatness</i>. Paul, where have you been? -Paul. -Gauguin. What the devil are you doing, Gauguin? You were supposed to attend to these this morning! Gauguin, attend to these immediately. We are losing money! -What are you doing? -Paul, don't! Gauguin. Stop it! Stop it at once! Do you want to be dismissed? You're dismissed. Do you hear me? You are dismissed! -Paint? -Yes, that's right. l see. And exactly what are we going to live on? -We've got money that l've saved. -And when it runs out? -Feel better? -Much better. Good. l want you to back to the Bourse, apologize to M. Bertin... tell him you had a mental aberration and get your job back. Mette, l am absolutely serious. l am done with stockbroking. -l am going to paint. -You don't know a thing about it! -Mette, l've got talent. l know it. -Now we get to it. -The Gospel according to Pissarro. -lt's what l want to do. He's just flattering you so you buy more of his ridiculous paintings! What's the matter with you? You used to have some sort of judgment. lf you think l'm going to live like Lucy Pissarro, l tell you, l am not. Mette, what has happened to you? -What are you talking about? -When you accepted my proposal... l had no prospects, no money. You wanted to leave Copenhagen. You wanted a live of adventure. You wanted to move to Paris! -What has happened? -l'll tell you, 4 children, Paul. Have you thought about them? Their schools, education, future? No, you haven't. Do you remember how appalled your family was... when you told them you were going to marry me? l'm beginning to wish l had listened to them. Do you remember what you wrote them? Because l do. ''Whatever Paul decides to do, he will succeed... because he's that sort of man.'' l am still that sort of man, Mette. l can be a painter. l can be a great painter. l've come all this way to paint... and l can't paint! 0bviously, it's not the best part of town. Are there worse parts? lt's just around the corner, here. Here. Here we are. Now, just wait till you see inside. Five minutes from the country. Better for the children. Let's not pretend this has anything to do with the children. -lt's perfect. -For you. Mette. Mette. l have drifted my entire life. l drifted into the Merchant Marines. l drifted into stockbroking. Twice l've taken positive steps. 0ne was running away from school... and the other was marrying you. Now l know exactly what l want to do. l know it with absolute certainty. Please, share this adventure with me, Mette. l promise you, you will never regret it. ''For the Lord your God is a merciful God. He will not forsake you, nor destroy you. Take heed to yourselves, lest you make for yourselves a carved image... in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you. When you are in distress with all these things upon you...'' Father Maurrin. Back. Keep back. Stay back. Stay away. Stay away. Back. -Easy, steady on. -Stay away. -What are you going to do with it? -Burn it, of course. -lt's a work of art. -lt's an abomination. Keep away. Steady on. Stay back. Easy. Keep back. Stay back. Hold back. ''You shall not make for yourselves a carved image... any likeness of anything that is in heaven above... or on the earth below, or in the water beneath the earth. You shall not bow down to a carved image... nor serve it... for l, the Lord your God... am a jealous God. You shall not show honor to other Gods. You shall destroy their altars and bring down their sacred places... cut down their wooden images and burn them with fire. Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house... less you be doomed to destruction likewise. You shall utterly detest it, and utterly abhor it... for it is a cursed thing. So says the Lord your God.'' You think l won't do you in because you're white? Get out of here! Can l help? Please. -How long has she been like this? -Two days. Well, you seem to have cured her. Tehura! Maurrin! Maurrin! How does it feel? How does it feel, you bastard? How does it feel? How does that feel? 0pen! Are you sure? The pink one? We can see it there at that shop. What are you doing? Papa! l've got a new dress. Come on now, inside. Come inside. Go to your room Clovis. And you, Aline. -But, Mama... -At once. lt's not what you think. Take a look. Three weeks ago l was passing by Suzanne's room. lt was her day off. She was mending one of her shirts and suddenly l saw her picture. l had no idea she was in the habit of doing her sewing stark naked. What an interesting sidelight to her character. She was not naked. ln my vision of the picture, she was. -No doubt. -Nude is the greatest challenge. l felt l should attempt one. She was just posing for me. As l am conveniently out of the house. l suppose you're sleeping with her. No, as a matter of fact, l am not. ls this really what she looks like, or are you just a very bad painter? Marvelous. Beautiful, beautiful work. Paul. You know who that is? -Huysmans, the critic. -ls it? Do you like it? Please, forgive me, M. Huysmans. l am one of your many readers. l'm an admirer. l'm also a small art collector. Well, in a sort of way. -This interests you? -Yes, it does. lt should. lt's remarkable. The nude as the nude should be. As only Rembrandt ever painted it. This is a girl of our own day. Not posing or simpering, but doing something useful... mending her clothes. Gauguin has it in him to be a great artist. ln my opinion, you should certainly consider investing in him. l will, thank you. Rembrandt. You see, Mette? Come along. -Gauguin is here, come quickly! -Bravo! Bravo! -Gauguin, the new Rembrandt. -Come along. Bravo, bravo! -Congratulations! -Bravo! Cheers to Gauguin! There you are. l paid your bail. Come, get up. -Sign here. -What was the charge? Destruction of church property. Don't worry. They'll drop the charges. They don't like putting a white in the dock. lt makes the natives uppity. Anyway... l've paid Father Maurrin compensation of 50 francs. -50 francs? -He's done very nicely out of this. l've also paid him the rent you owe him, too. l reckon you better think about painting me a mural. Why the hell did Maurrin take the rent? You'd think he'd want to get rid of me. Everyone needs enemies, especially in the colonies. lt helps keeps the boredom at bay. Anyway, he wants the money. They're all the same. ''Come unto me all of ye who are heavily laden.'' Except it's cash in advance, there's no credit. Hypocritical bastard. -Still, l am grateful to him. -Are you? l haven't been able to work or paint since l got here. Your mind's been on other things. lt's not a lack of subjects here, l'm surrounded by them. lt's not good enough just to paint. You have to say something. l'll take your word for it. When l watched them burn the idol, l knew exactly what l must do. Men like Maurrin, they're destroying these islands. ln a few years, all of this will be gone. But l can keep a record, with paint on canvass l can show people... what there was, what was here. You think so? -Yes. -l don't. You're right, in a few years time it will all be gone. A bit of paint on canvass isn't going to make any bloody difference. You're wrong. -Show me. -No. Give it back! Children! Children! l'm selling a painting. No, madam never buys at the door. Emile, have you washed your hands? Let me see. The other one. Give it another wash. -But Mama... -Go on. Stop lolling about and put the food on the table. -But l have a test tomorrow. -Will you do as your told? Now. Where have you been? Where have you been? Where? l've written to my family. My grandmother will take us. What are you talking about? l'm taking the children to Copenhagen. Don't be ridiculous, Mette. What the hell else do you expect me to do? lt's only a matter of time. lt's only a matter of time before we'll be starving, Paul! There is no more money. Can you get that into your head? -We'll make do! -We'll make... For God's sake! For the first time in my life l am doing something that l want to do! Something that is worthwhile! And l will not give it up! ''l, l, l... '' What about the children? What about me? What do you want me to do? What? Do you want me to go back to Paris? To do work that l despise? So that you can swan up and down the Champs-Elysees... in a carriage? 0r perhaps you would like to arrange a perfect marriage... for our daughter Aline. 0r turn our three sons into bank managers. lt is rubbish. lt is worthless rubbish. First you were going to be the toast of art critics at cafes. That didn't last very long, did it? Then off to Rouen. The children get taken out of their schools... and they lose their friends. And it's all worth it, isn't it? Because we can live so much more cheaply in Rouen, can't we? The bourgeois of Rouen... they're falling all over themselves brawling to buy Papa's paintings. And how many have you sold? Not a single one! Don't you think it's time to stop and ask yourself why? l'll tell you why. Here. You're an amateur. You understand that? Look at it. Look at it. Look at your rubbish. l'm suppose to go without for this! For this! -l'm supposed to go without... -How dare you? How dare you? -How dare you? -Go on, hit me. Hit me, you... You'll make it easier. Unless you stop this madness, l'm leaving you. You know what you are? You're a fucking genius. You're a fucking genius! Fucking genius! Genius! Paradise this place could be. Garden of bloody Eden. You know what fucked it all up? Missionaries. Bastards like Maurrin. That's what fucked it up. l'm going to kill the bastard. Father fucking Maurrin! l'm going to kill him. That's a brilliant idea. l'm going to kill the bastard. l'm going to shoot the bastard. Arnaud. Arnaud. -Father Maurrin. Charming to see you. -Are you alright? -l'm going to kill you. -Arnaud. You are drunk. Charles? 0h, Christ. What are you scared of, Father? Don't you want to meet God? No problem there, surely. A blameless life in the service of Mother Church... converting the benighted fuzzy-wuzzyies. Making sure the native girls don't show us their lovely tities... and the boys don't get their cocks out on Sundays! You don't look too happy. A few dark corners? Your dirty little secrets? 0r is it just occurring to you... you might just be damned to hell for what you've done here already? There's only one way to find out. Charles! -lt's just my little joke. -Are you alright? Do you think l scared him? -Yes, l should say so. -Good. Maybe l should have killed him. -Why? You're no better. -What? Think about it, Charles. First came the missionaries. But then came the traders. What did the missionaries want? Souls. The traders the easy money and the result... Well, Charles, the result was this. -What exactly do you mean by that? -You're shit's on the doorstep too. -You better take that back! -Six shots, Charles, it's empty. For Christ's sake, it's not even your fault. lt's no one's fault. lt is what it is. Paul. -Schuff, what are you doing here? -0ld Bertin's given me the day off. How good of him. He asked me to say you can have your job back whenever you like. You've come all this way just to tell me that? Mette wrote to me. -She's been writing to everybody. -She's very distressed. Paul, she means it, she'll leave you. l really don't understand how you can do this to her. Paul, you'll never make a living as a painter. God knows it's hard enough for a professional. Come back to Paris. That is your advice for me, is it Schuff? lt's obvious. Let me give you some advice of my own. You had best mind your own fucking business. Come back, Paul. l can't. Emile. Clovis. Aline. Aline. Sweetheart. lt won't be for long, l promise. Sweetheart. l hate you painting! l hate it! l hate it! l hate it! Aline, that's enough, now. Come on, come on. Aline. How can you do this, Paul? How can you do this? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Aline. l thought l should thank you. -l don't think you were in danger. -Nevertheless. That's all l had to say. l must be on my way. l want to paint an idol. When l first came here, l was posted to one of the outlying islands. l was the first missionary ever to go there. l'd been warned about idol worship. But nothing prepared me for what l found. l saw men groveling in the dirt in front of that hideous thing... that they called their god. Spilling their blood to appease it. l looked in its face and l knew what it was. lt was darkness, primeval knight. The Evil 0ne. ln that instant, l knew why God had sent me here. What he was calling me to do. Destroy it... and all other idols. That's what l've done, and that's what l will continue to do... until these islands are cleansed. What are you doing? Get changed. Why? l know where there's an idol. lt's a hard road, Paul. l did warn you. lt's a hard road to travel alone. l miss Mette and the children. How can l go back? l belong here. The friend would say one thing, the artist would say another. What would the artist say? Look, if you have a vision, if you're faithful to it... and if in the end you succeed, then you do something important... not just for yourself. The artist defies the society he lives in because... he can see further and deeper than other men. Sometimes, there's a price. And what would the friend say? The price is too high for you, Paul. Go to Copenhagen. Papa! Children! Aline. -Papa. -Aline. -We've got a puppy. -Yes, so l see. -He's sweet. l walk him every day. -You do, do you? Jean-Rene. And Clovis. Mette. Paul. -0h dear. -0h, God. -Look at it all over you. -lt doesn't matter. -Where is Emile? -He's inside. Come on, everybody, let's go. And this one sounds like it's for you. -Thank you. -And this one's for you. -Thank you. -And for me, l got a job. -What? -Well, not exactly a job. lt's an agency that pays on commission for a company in France. Aren't you going to paint anymore then? No, Papa is not going to paint anymore. Go on, open it. l'll hold the puppy. Look at that. Marthe said she can help me find a job teaching French to young men... in the diplomatic corps. She said her best friend is headmaster of the academy. lt's the best school in Denmark. lt would be wonderful for Emile and Jean-Rene. -She would help with the fees. -Mette. Good afternoon. l represent the firm of D'Ely of Robaille. My name is Paul Gauguin. Please, take my card. 0ur canvasses have been chemically treated according to a new formula... making them completely water-resistant. But, of course, the true strength of the canvas is in the weave. We use a traditional pattern, making them incredibly strong... yet very flexible. Please feel. lt has the strength of a sail, yet you can fold it like a sheet. Right. Thank you. But, of course, the real strength in the canvas is the weave. We use a traditional pattern, making it incredibly strong... yet, at the same time it is flexible. lt is as strong as a sail, yet you can fold it like a sheet. l see what you mean. l'll ask my colleague to take a look. lt won't take a minute. l like what you're selling, but l'm not sure l like your prices so much. Monsieur? Monsieur! ''Tatavahine''! You're too late, Maurrin! Tehura! Tehura! Tehura! -Tehura! -You are the same! Tehura! -Come, come. -Turpentine... Papa's painting again! Alright, now go upstairs, everybody. Come along. Come. l have to leave. l'm sorry. l'm sorry? l must be able to paint. l must. You can paint. You can paint here. l can't. -Why not? -l just said l can't. -Paul! -Pissarro, Monet, the rest of them... they think they are leading the way. The fact of the matter is that they are lost. They are stuck! They have led themselves down a blind alley... and they no longer know in which direction to go. But l do! Me! l am going to do something different. Something nobody has ever seen before, Mette. Mette, l am here to start a revolution. No, l did not think you would understand. l understand. l understand exactly. Life's just too bloody slow for you here, isn't it? No cafes, no women. That's the truth, isn't it? lt's got nothing to do with art. Nothing! You don't give a damn about me or the children. You never have. lf you leave now, l'm never going to take you back, Paul. l promise you. lt's bloody marvelous. You can have it, if you want. lt's too good for me. l might have one of these other ones. You've done it, haven't you? You can go home now. Mette. l thought when you were late perhaps you had changed your mind. After coming all this way, l couldn't find a cab. Thank you for coming. -Pissarro is here. -0h, that devil. -Would you like to see him? -0f course. l could hardly recognize him. Look at him in that hat. You could mistake him for a stockbroker. -What happened? -He's a big success now. People have come around to him. He's fetching huge prices. -How wonderful. -Mette. How very good to see you after all these years. -Camille, you're looking well. -Well, l can't grumble. -How's Lucy? -Well, very well. -The children? -Flourishing. All of them? Well, your husband's been up to some tricks. So, what do you think, Camille? You promised to give me a candid opinion. -Let's not spoil the occasion. -Ah, you don't approve. Paul, l don't understand. All this ugliness, this brutality... the garish colors. Why? Why can't you paint harmonious things? Beautiful things. A river at sunset... daffodils in spring... that is how to make money, Camille. This... What the devil does it mean? -You really don't understand? -No, l don't. Please enlighten me. What has happened to you, Camille? lt is obvious, surely. The bitch and her litter symbolizes primal birth, our origin as animals. The women show how we have evolved into sentient beings... capable of knowing ourselves and God. The idol represents our capacity in its so-called primitive form. The Last Supper is what Christians claim is eating in its ultimate form. But the women... the women here serving at the Lord's table, they show us... that all religions aim to express the same mysteries... in a myriad of different forms... just like art itself. 0h, my dear, a red dog. Hush. Barbarians. Well... Yes, of course, you must be leaving. Camille, l am so glad you came. Don't give up. Whatever happens, don't give up. Yes. So much for the revolution. This was to be my great triumph... to justify everything l've made you suffer, Mette. My God. That's better. You wouldn't let a little thing like total disaster bring you down. Not you. l think you're getting somewhere, at last. lt's beautiful. Then again, l don't have any taste at all in such things, do l? l don't know. You seem to be showing remarkable signs of improvement. lt's wonderful. You could do even better. -You think so? -l'm sure of it. God, l wish l was. l can feel the warmth of the sun. l can... l can hear the whisper of the breeze... and l can smell the flowers in the trees. l feel l know these people. l found out what their lives are like and you brought that. You. You always said you could be a great painter, and you are. You're a great painter. And painting will never be the same. The revolution has started. Go back, Paul. Go back and finish it. Go back to the South Seas, it's where you belong. No. Yes. For once in your life, will you do as l say? Now that would be a revolution. To the barricades.

Who knows where that comes from? <i>Anybody?</i> [ Coughing, Blowing Nose ] Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr Abraham Lincoln. Now in this class you can either call me Mr Keating... or, if you're slightly more daring, ''O Captain, my Captain.'' <i>[ Scattered Snickering ]</i> Now, let me dispel a few rumours so they don't fester into facts. Yes, I, too, attended Hell-ton and survived. And, no, at that time, I was not the mental giant you see before you. I was the intellectual equivalent of a 98-pound weakling. I would go to the beach, and people would kick copies of Byron in my face. [ Chuckling ] <i>Now... Mr Pitts?</i> That's a rather unfortunate name. <i>- Mr Pitts, where are you?</i> <i>- [ Boys Snickering ]</i> Mr Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542. Read the first stanza of the poem you find there. [ Spaz Coughs ] ''To the Virgins to Make Much of Time''? <i>[ Keating ]</i> <i>Yes, that's the one.</i> - Somewhat appropriate, isn't it? <i>- [ Boys Chuckling ]</i> <i>[ Pitts ]</i> <i>''Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.</i> ''Old Time is still a-flying. And this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying.'' Thank you, Mr Pitts. ''Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.'' The Latin term for that sentiment is <i>''Carpe diem. ''</i> Now, who knows what that means? <i>Carpe diem.</i> That's ''Seize the day.'' - Very good, Mister-- <i>- Meeks.</i> Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the day. ''Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.'' Why does the writer use these lines? - Because he's in a hurry. - No! Ding! <i>Thank you</i> <i>for playing anyway.</i> Because we are food for worms, lads. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room... <i>is one day going to stop breathing,</i> <i>turn cold and die.</i> I would like you to step forward over here... and peruse some of the faces from the past. You've walked past them many times. I don't think you've really looked at them. <i>They're not that different</i> <i>from you, are they?</i> <i>Same haircuts.</i> Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. <i>Their eyes are full of hope,</i> <i>just like you.</i> <i>Did they wait</i> <i>until it was too late...</i> <i>to make from their lives even one iota</i> <i>of what they were capable?</i> <i>Because, you see, gentlemen, these</i> <i>boys are now fertilizing daffodils.</i> But if you listen real close... you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. <i>Listen.</i> <i>Do you hear it?</i> <i>[ Keating Whispering ]</i> Carpe. Hear it? [ Whispering ] <i>Carpe.</i> <i>[ Continues Whispering ]</i> Carpe diem. <i>Seize the day, boys.</i> <i>Make your lives</i> <i>extraordinary.</i> [ Chattering ] - That was weird. - But different.

Who's up for a quick study group tonight, guys? - [ Cameron, Pitts ] Me. - What? I can't make it, guys. I have to have dinner at the Danburrys' house tonight. <i>[ Pitts ] The Danburrys?</i> <i>Who are the Danburrys?</i> [ Cameron ] Big alums. How'd you swing that? Friends of my dad's. They're probably in their nineties or something. Ooh! Anything's better than Hell-ton hash, Knox. - [ Charlie ] I'll second that. <i>- [ Knox ] Yeah, we'll see.</i> - You coming to the study group tonight? - [ Others Chattering ] Uh... no.

Psycho!</i> - Yes! - To Queen-Six. <i>-Another game?</i> <i>- What do you mean?</i> - Duh! <i>just replace these numbers here</i> <i>with 'x, ''for 'x''and 'y. ''</i> - Of course. - Of course. So what's the problem? <i>[ Boy ] You think I can get in there?</i> <i>You've been hogging it all day.</i> - Wait. No. - How was dinner? Huh? <i>- How was dinner?</i> - Terrible. - Awful. <i>- Why? What happened?</i> [ Sighs ] Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl... I have ever seen in my entire life. Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? <i>She's practically engaged</i> <i>to Chet Danburry.</i> - [ Groans ] - That guy could eat a football. - Too bad. <i>- [ Knox ] ''Too bad''?</i> It's worse than ''too bad,'' Pittsie. It's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in love with such a jerk. All the good ones go for jerks. You know that. Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book and try and figure out problem five. I can't just forget her, Cameron. And I certainly can't think about trig. - [ Radio Humming ] - We got it! All right, gentlemen. Five minutes. - [ Radio Continues Humming ] - Let's go. - Did you see her naked? [ Chuckles ] - Very funny, Dalton. <i>- [ Radio Static ]</i> - That wouldn't be a radio in your lap, <i>- would it, Mr Pitts?</i> - No, sir. Science experiment. <i>Radar.</i> [ Radio Continues Humming ] Gentlemen, open your text to page 2 1 of the introduction. Mr Perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled ''Understanding Poetry.'' '''Understand Poetry' by Dr J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. ''To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent... ''with its metre, rhyme and figures of speech. <i>''Then ask two questions.</i> <i>''One.: How artfully has the objective</i> <i>of the poem been rendered?</i> <i>'And, two.: How important</i> <i>is that objective?</i> <i>''Question one rates</i> <i>the poem's perfection.</i> <i>''Question two rates</i> <i>its importance.</i> <i>'And once these questions</i> <i>have been answered...</i> <i>''determining a poem's greatness</i> <i>becomes a relatively simple matter.</i> <i>''If the poem's score</i> <i>for perfection is plotted...</i> <i>''on the horizontal</i> <i>of a graph...</i> <i>''and its importance</i> <i>is plotted on the vertical,</i> ''then calculating the total area of the poem... ''yields the measure of its greatness. ''A sonnet by Byron might score high on the vertical, <i>''but only average</i> <i>on the horizontal.</i> <i>'A Shakespearean sonnet,</i> <i>on the other hand,</i> ''would score high both horizontally and vertically, <i>'yielding</i> <i>a massive total area;:</i> ''thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. <i>'As you proceed through the poetry in</i> <i>this book, practise this rating method.</i> <i>'As your ability to evaluate</i> <i>poems in this manner grows,</i> so will-- so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.'' Excrement. That's what I think of Mr J. Evans Pritchard. <i>We're not laying pipe.</i> <i>We're talking about poetry.</i> <i>I mean, how can you describe poetry</i> <i>like</i> American Bandstand? ''I like Byron. I give him a 42. But I can't dance to it.'' <i>Now, I want you</i> <i>to rip out that page.</i> Go on. Rip out the entire page. <i>You heard me.</i> <i>Rip it out.</i> <i>Rip it out!</i> Go on. Rip it out. <i>Thank you, Mr Dalton.</i> <i>Gentlemen, tell you what.</i> <i>Don't just tear out that page.</i> <i>Tear out the entire introduction.</i> <i>I want it gone, history. Leave nothing.</i> Rip it out! Rip! Be gone, J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.! <i>Rip! Shred! Tear!</i> <i>Rip it out! I want to hear nothing</i> <i>but ripping of Mr Pritchard!</i> <i>- We'll perforate it, put it on a roll!</i> <i>- [ Boys Chuckling ]</i> It's not the Bible. You're not gonna go to hell for this. <i>- [ Boys Chuckling ]</i> - [ Mumbling ] Go on. Make a clean tear. I want nothing left of it. <i>- [ Boys Chattering ]</i> - We shouldn't be doing this. Rip! Rip! Rip! <i>[ Keating ]</i> <i>Rip it out! Rip!</i> <i>[ Boys Chattering,</i> <i>Pages Ripping ]</i> <i>[ Boys Laughing ]</i> <i>Rip it! Yeah! Rip it out!</i> [ Muffled Chattering, Laughing ] <i>- [ Boy ] Rip it!</i> - What the hell is going on here? - I don't hear enough rips. - Mr Keating. Mr McAllister. I'm sorry, I-- I didn't know you were here. - I am. - <i>Ah. So you are.</i> Excuse me. [ Keating ] Keep ripping, gentlemen. <i>This is a battle, a war.</i> And the casualties could be your hearts and souls. Thank you, Mr Dalton. Armies of academics going forward measuring poetry. <i>No! We will not</i> <i>have that here.</i> <i>No more</i> <i>of MrJ. Evans Pritchard.</i> <i>Now, my class, you will learn</i> <i>to think for yourselves again.</i> You will learn to savour words and language. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas <i>can</i> change the world. I see that look in Mr Pitts' eye... like 1 9th century literature has nothing to do... with going to business school or medical school. Right? Maybe. Mr Hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking, ''Yes, we should simply study our Mr Pritchard... ''and learn our rhyme and metre and go quietly about the business... of achieving other ambitions.'' I have a little secret for you. Huddle up. Huddle up! We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering: these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love-- these are what we stay alive for. <i>To quote from Whitman.:</i> <i>''O me, O life of the questions</i> <i>of these recurring.</i> <i>''Of the endless trains</i> <i>of the faithless.</i> <i>''Of cities filled</i> <i>with the foolish.</i> ''What good amid these, O me, O life? ''Answer: That you are here. ''That life exists and identity. ''That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.'' ''That the powerful play goes on, <i>and you may contribute</i> <i>a verse. ''</i> What will your verse be? [ All ] For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen. Quite an interesting class you gave today, Mr Keating. - Sorry if I shocked you, Mr McAllister. - There's no need to apologise. It was very fascinating, misguided though it was. You think so? You take a big risk by encouraging them to become artists,John. When they realize that they're not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts, they'll hate you for it. We're not talking artists, George. We're talking freethinkers. Freethinkers at 1 7? Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic. Not a cynic. <i>A realist.</i> ''Show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll show you a happy man.'' ''But only in their dreams can men be truly free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus will be.'' Tennyson? No. Keating. [ Chuckling ] Hey, I found his senior annual in the library. <i>Listen to this.</i> <i>Captain of the soccer team.</i> <i>Editor of the school annual.</i> <i>Cambridge bound.</i> Thigh man and the Dead Poets Society. ''Man Most Likely To Do Anything.'' Thigh man? Mr ''K'' was a hell-raiser. - [ Chuckling ] - What's the Dead Poets Society? - I don't know. - Is there a picture in the annual? - Nothing. No other mention of it. <i>- [ Nolan ] That boy there,</i> <i>see me after lunch.</i> ## [ Whistling <i>1 8 1 2 Overture</i> ] [ Neil ] Mr Keating? - ## [ Continues Whistling ] - Mr Keating? - ## [ Continues ] <i>- Sir?</i> - Say something. - O Captain, my Captain? - Gentlemen. - [ Boys Laugh ] We were just looking in your old annual. - Oh, my God. [ Laughs ] - [ Laughing ] - No, that's not me. - [ Boys Laugh ] Stanley ''The Tool'' Wilson. [ Chuckling ] <i>- [ Chuckling ] God.</i> - What was the Dead Poets Society? I doubt the present administration would look too favourably upon that. Why? What was it? - Gentlemen, can you keep a secret? - Sure. The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke at the beginning of every meeting. You see, we would gather at the old Indian cave... and take turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, Shelley-- the biggies. <i>Even some of our own verse.</i> And in the enchantment of the moment, we'd let poetry work its magic. You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around, reading poetry? No, Mr Overstreet. It wasn't just <i>guys.</i> We weren't a Greek organization. We were romantics. We didn't just read poetry, we let it drip from our tongues, like honey. <i>Spirits soared, women swooned</i> <i>and gods were created, gentlemen.</i> Not a bad way to spend an evening, eh? Hmm. Thank you, Mr Perry, for this stroll down amnesia lane. Burn that. <i>- Especially my picture.</i> - [ Boys Chuckle ] - ## [ Resumes Whistling ] - Dead Poets Society. <i>[ Cameron ]</i> <i>What?</i> <i>[ Bell Ringing ]</i> - I say we go tonight. - Tonight? - Wait a minute. - Everybody in? - Where's this cave he's talking about? - It's beyond the stream. - I know where it is. - [ Pitts ] That's miles. - Sounds boring to me. <i>- [ Charlie ] Don't go.</i> - You know how many demerits we're talking? - So don't come. Please. Look, all I'm saying is that we have to be careful. - We can't get caught. - No shit, Sherlock. You boys there! Hurry up! - All right, who's in? - Aw, come on, Neil. Hager's-- Forget Hager! No! Who's in? I'm in. <i>[ Hager Clapping ]</i> <i>I'm warning you! Move!</i> Me too. - I don't know, Neil. - What?

Come on, Knox. It'll help you get Chris. Yeah? How? - Women swoon. [ Laughing ] - But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me why they swoon! Charlie! [ Boys Whispering ] [ Neil Whispering ] Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall. It's right there. It's got to be on the banks. I don't know. This is starting to sound dangerous. - Oh, well, why don't you stay home? - Hey, you're crazy. For God's sake, stop chattering and sit down. - Todd, are you coming tonight? - No. Why not? God, you were there. You heard Keating. - Don't you want to do something about that? - Yes. - But-- - But? But what? Keating said that everybody took turns reading, and I don't want to do that. Gosh, you really have a problem with that, don't you? N-No, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just-- I don't want to do it, okay? All right. What if you didn't have to read?

The meetings will be conducted by myself... and the other new initiates now present. Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, <i>will keep minutes</i> <i>of the meetings.</i> I'll now read the traditional opening message... by Society member Henry David Thoreau. ''I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.'' I'll second that. [ Laughs ] ''To put to rout all that was not life. ''And not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.'' [ Whistles ] - Keating's marked a bunch of other pages. <i>-All right, intermission!</i> Dig deep. Right here.

But as she pieced the puzzle together, she realized, to her astonishment, that the image that was formed was her very own room. And the figure in the centre of the puzzle, as she completed it, was herself. <i>And with trembling hands,</i> <i>she placed the last four pieces...</i> <i>and stared in horror at the face</i> <i>of a demented madman at the window.</i> The last thing that this old lady ever heard... - was the sound of breaking glass. - No, she didn't. - [ Laughing, Chattering ] - Yes, this is true. This is true. - I've got one that's better than that. <i>- [ Charlie Laughs ]</i> I do. There's a young, married couple, and they're driving through the forest at night on a long trip. And they run out of gas, and there's a madman on the-- The thing with the hand? <i>- [ All Chattering ]</i> - I love that story! <i>- [ Charlie ] I told you that one.</i> - You did not. - I got that in camp in sixth grade. - Last year? ''In a mean abode in the Shanking Road, ''lived a man named William Bloat. ''Now, he had a wife, the plague of his life, ''who continually got his goat. ''And one day at dawn, with her nightshift on, he slit her bloody throat.'' - [ All Chuckling ] - [ Pitts ] Oh, and it gets worse. You want to hear a real poem? -You want this? -No, I don't need-- Get this outta here. - What, did you bring one? - You memorized a poem? - [ Mumbling ] - You memorized a poem? - An original piece by Charlie Dalton. - An original piece. - Take centre stage. - You know, this is history, right? - [ Laughing ] - [ Clears Throat ] <i>[ Boys Gasp ]</i> <i>Wow. Whoa.</i> - Where did you get that? - [ Laughing ] <i>[ Cameron ]</i> <i>Where did you--</i> - Whoa. - ''Teach me to love? ''Go teach thyself more wit. ''I chief professor am of it. ''The god of love, if such a thing there be, may learn to love from me.'' <i>[ Neil ]</i> <i>Wow. Did you write that?</i> [ Clapping, Cheering ] Abraham Cowley. Okay. Who's next? Alfred Lord Tennyson. ''Come, my friends. '''Tis not too late to seek a newer world. ''For my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset. ''And though we are not now that strength...

A lot of you look forward to this... about as much as you look forward to root canal work. We're gonna talk about Shakespeare... <i>as someone who writes</i> <i>something very interesting.</i> Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare done very much like this: [ British Accent ] ''O, Titus, bring your friend hither.'' But if any of you have seen Mr Marlon Brando, [ Imitating Brando ] you know that Shakespeare can be different. ''Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.'' <i>[ Boys Laughing ]</i> You can also imagine maybe John Wayne as Macbeth going... [ Imitating Wayne ] ''Well, is this a dagger I see before me?''

You don't believe me? <i>Come see for yourselves.</i> <i>Come on.</i> Come on.Just when you think you know something, you have to look at it in another way. Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try. Now when you read, don't just consider what the author thinks. - Consider what <i>you</i> think. - [ Jumps Down ] Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, <i>the less likely you are</i> <i>to find it at all.</i> Thoreau said, ''Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.'' Don't be resigned to that. Break out. <i>Don't just walk off the edge</i> <i>like lemmings. Look around you.</i> <i>- [ Bell Ringing ]</i> - There you go, Mr Priske. Thank you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find new ground. <i>- [ Tolling Continues ]</i> - Now, in addition to your essays, I would like you to compose a poem of your own, an original work. - [ Boys Groaning ] - Ooh! ## [ Hums Ominous Tune ] That's right.

Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to try this! I even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. For the first time in my whole life, I know what I want to do.

How are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? First, I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that. But won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't tell him? No, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this. - Well, that's impossible. <i>- Bullshit. Nothing's impossible.</i> Well, why don't you just call him and ask him and m-maybe he'll say yes. That's a laugh. If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him. - Yeah, but if he said no before-- -Jesus, Todd, whose side are you on? [ Grabs Flyer ] I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a little while? - You're coming to the meeting? - I don't know. Maybe. Nothing Mr Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd? - Wh-What is that supposed to mean? - You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. - So you want me out? <i>- No, I want you in!</i> But being in means you gotta do something, not just say you're in. Listen, Neil, I mean, I appreciate this concern, but I'm not like you, all right? You-- You-You say things and people listen. I-- I-I'm not like that. - Don't you think you could be? <i>- No.</i> I-- I-I don't know, but that's not the point. The point is, there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out.

We're not laughing at you, we're laughing near you. I don't mind that your poem had a simple theme. Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things, like a cat or a flower or rain. You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, who's next? Mr Anderson, I see you sitting there in agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put you out of your misery. I-I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem. Mr Anderson thinks everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. <i>Isn't that right, Todd?</i> <i>Isn't that your worst fear?</i> Well, I think you're wrong. I think you have something inside of you... that is worth a great deal. ''I sound... ''my barbaric... ''yawp... <i>[ Continues Writing ]</i> <i>''over the rooftops...</i> <i>of the world. ''</i> W.W.

There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there. <i>What does he remind you of?</i> <i>Don't think, answer. Go on.</i> - A m-m-m-madman. <i>- [ Keating ] What kind of madman?</i> - Don't think about it, just answer. - A cr-crazy madman. No, you can do better than that. Free up your mind. Use your imagination. Say the first thing that pops into your head, even if it's total gibberish. A-A-A sweaty-toothed madman. Good God, boy, there's a poet in you after all! There. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close them. Now, describe what you see. - Uh, I-I close my eyes... - Yes? - uh, and his image floats beside me. - A sweaty-toothed madman.

He knew he'll get there one day. Mr Cameron. You could see him thinking, ''Is this right? It might be right. It might be right. I know that-- Maybe not. I don't know.'' Mr Overstreet, driven by a deeper force. Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. I brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity. The difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. Now, I see the look in your eyes like, <i>''I</i> would have walked differently.'' <i>Well, ask yourselves</i> <i>why you were clapping.</i> Now we all have a great need for acceptance. But you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own. Even though others may think them odd or unpopular. Even though the herd may go, ''That's ba-a-a-a-ad.'' - [ Boys Laughing ] <i>- [ Keating ] Robert Frost said,</i> ''Two roads diverged in the wood and I, I took the one less traveled by.

[ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. The funny thing is, about this, is I didn't even like it the first time. <i>- [ Laughs ]</i> - [ Laughs ] Todd, I think you're underestimating the value of this desk set. I mean, who would want a football or a baseball-- - Or a car. <i>- Mm-hmm, or a car--</i> if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one. I mean, if I were ever going to buy a desk set... twice, I would probably buy this one... both times. [ Laughing ] In fact, its... shape is-- It's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? <i>You can feel it.</i> [ Exhales ] This desk set wants to fly. Todd... the world's first unmanned flying desk set.

Well, don't you think they're gonna figure out who wrote it? <i>They're gonna come to you and ask</i> <i>to know what the Dead Poets Society is.</i> <i>Charlie, you had no right</i> <i>to do something like that.</i> It's Nuwanda, Cameron. <i>[ Gloria ]</i> <i>That's right.

This could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club. Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. - [ Whispering ] - Fine. Sit. In this week's issue of <i>Welton Honor,</i> there appeared a profane and unauthorized article. Rather than spend my valuable time ferreting out the guilty persons-- and let me assure you I will find them-- I'm asking any and all students who know anything about this article... <i>to make themselves known</i> <i>here and now.</i> Whoever the guilty persons are, this is your only chance to avoid expulsion from this school. <i>[ Phone Ringing,</i> <i>Teachers Murmuring ]</i> Welton Academy. Hello. <i>Yes, he is.</i> <i>just a moment.</i> Mr Nolan, it's for you. <i>It's God!</i> He says we should have girls at Welton. [ Boys Laughing ] Wipe that smirk off your face. If you think, Mr Dalton, that you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again. Others have had similar notions and have failed just as surely as you will fail. - Assume the position. - [ Sighs ] Count aloud, Mr Dalton. <i>[ Paddle Strikes ]</i> One. [ Strikes Dalton ] <i>Two.</i> [ Strikes Dalton ] Three. - [ Strikes Dalton ] <i>- Four. [ Stifles Groan ]</i> <i>- [ Paddle Strikes ]</i> - Five. What is this Dead Poets Society? I want names.

So what are you gonna do? - Charlie-- - Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda. <i>[ Door Closes ]</i> [ Both Chuckling ] Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr Keating? Certainly. This was my first classroom,John. Did you know that? My first desk. <i>I didn't know you taught,</i> <i>Mr Nolan.</i> English. Long before your time. It was hard giving it up, I can tell you. I'm hearing rumours about some unorthodox teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they've had anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you boys his age are very impressionable. Well, your reprimand made quite an impression, I'm sure. - What was going on in the courtyard the other day? - Courtyard? - Boys marching, clapping in unison. - Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove a point: dangers of conformity. Well,John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same? I always thought the idea of education was to learn to think for yourself. At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition,John. Discipline. Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself. <i>[ Footsteps Departing ]</i> - Creak. [ Hits Bongo Drum ] - [ Chuckling ] He starts walking around towards my left. Creak. Creak. [ Hitting Bongo Drum ] <i>'Assume the position, Mr Dalton, ''</i> <i>which means--</i> [ Keating ] All right, gentlemen. - Mr Keating. - Mr Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today. You're siding with Mr Nolan? What about <i>carpe diem</i> and sucking all the marrow... <i>- out of life and all that?</i> - Sucking the marrow out of life... <i>doesn't mean</i> <i>choking on the bone.</i> There is a time for daring, and there is a time for caution. And a wise man understands which is called for. But I thought you'd like that. No. You being expelled from school is not daring to me. It's stupid. <i>'Cause you'll miss some</i> <i>golden opportunities.</i> Yeah? Like what? Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes. Got it, ace? Aye, aye, Captain. Keep your head about you. That goes for the lot of you. - Yes, Captain. - Yes, Captain. Phone call from God.

Who put you up to it? - Was it this new man? Keating? - No. Nobody p-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in every class. Did you really think I wasn't going to find out? ''Oh, my niece is in a play with your son,'' says Mrs Marks. ''No, no, no,'' I say. ''You must be mistaken. My son's not in a play.'' You made a liar out of me, Neil! <i>Now, tomorrow, you go to them</i> <i>and you tell them that you're quitting.</i> No, I can't. I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night! I don't care if the world comes to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? <i>[ Louder ]</i> <i>Is that clear?</i> Yes, sir. I made a great many sacrifices to get you here, Neil, and you will not let me down. No, sir. <i>- [ Knocking ]</i> - It's open.

Sure. - Want some milk or sugar in that? - No, thanks. Gosh, they don't give you much room around here. It's part of the monastic oath. They don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching. - She's pretty. - She's also in London. - [ Laughs ] - Makes it a little difficult. - How do you stand it? - Stand what? You can go anywhere. You can do anything. How can you stand being here? Because I love teaching. I don't want to be anywhere else. - What's up? - I just talked to my father. He's making me quit the play at Henley Hall. But acting is everything to me. I mean-- But he doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's. I mean-- <i>But he's planning the rest</i> <i>of my life for me.</i> And he-he's never asked me what I want. Have you ever told your father what you just told me? <i>About your passion for acting?</i> <i>Have you showed him that?</i> - I can't. <i>- Why not?</i> I can't talk to him this way. Then you're acting for him too. You're playing the part of the dutiful son. <i>I know this sounds impossible,</i> <i>but you have to talk to him.</i> You have to show him who you are, what your heart is. I know what he'll say. He'll tell me that acting's a whim and I should forget it. [ Sniffling ] They're counting on me. He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind for my own good. You are not an indentured servant. <i>It's not a whim for you. You prove it to</i> <i>him by your conviction and your passion.</i> You show him that, and if he still doesn't believe you-- Well, by then, you'll be out of school, and you can do anything you want. No. [ Sniffling ] What about the play? The show's tomorrow night. Then you have to talk to him before tomorrow night. I-- [ Sighs ] - Isn't there an easier way? <i>- No.</i> [ Chuckles ] I'm trapped. <i>No, you're not.</i> [ All Chattering ] [ Chattering Continues ] Chris! Chris! Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? - Um, I think she's in Room 1 1 1 . - Thanks. I know. Excuse me. Chris-- Knox, what are you doing here? I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you. Knox, don't you know that if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you? - I don't care. I love you, Chris. - Knox, you're crazy.

She had to say something! <i>- [ Pitts ] Hey, Knox!</i> <i>- [ Knox Whooping ] Seize the day!</i> - Did you talk to your father? - Uh, yeah. He didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay in the play. <i>He won't be able to m-make it.</i> <i>He's in Chicago.</i> But, uh, I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. Really? You told him what you told me? Yeah. [ Chuckles ] He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone at least four days. I don't think he'll make the show, but... I think he'll let me stay with it. ''Keep up the schoolwork.'' [ Chuckles ] Thanks. [ Gathers Books, Exits ] - Oh, baby. - Beautiful baby. - I am-- - Excuse me. -Just a moment. Yes. You're so good. - [ Laughing ] Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix this. Come on, Nuwanda, we're going to miss Neil's entrance. He said something about getting red before we left. - ''Getting red''? What does that mean? - I-- You know Charlie. <i>[ Meeks ] So, Charlie,</i> <i>what's this 'getting red''bit?</i> - Ooh. [ Laughs ] - Ooh. [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] W-What is that? It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility.

It's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a fool out of me? I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. Well, you did. Chet found out. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. - Knox, you have got to stop this stuff. - I can't, Chris. I love you. Knox, you say that over and over. You don't-- You don't even know me. <i>[ Keating ]</i> <i>Will you bejoining us, Mr Overstreet?</i> <i>- [ Knox ] Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk.</i> - [ Starts Engine ] Knox. Knox, i-it just so happens... that I could care less about you. Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the play. - Are you going with him? - [ Laughs ] Chet? To a play? - Are you kidding? - Then come with me. Knox, you are so infuriating! Come on, Chris, just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever. - Uh-huh. - I promise. Dead Poets honour. You come with me tonight, and then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. - What would happen if Chet found out? - He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over. And I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it? - Dead Poets honour. - What is that? - My word. - Hmm. You are so infuriating. [ Laughing ] [ Whispering ] Hey, there he is!

November 1989 Last night, many East Germans crossed the border by just showing their IDs. Several West Berliners also paid a short visit to East Berlin. However, it has been announced that from 8 am onwards, an ID card will no longer be required. 11 years later, 20 prisoners jailed during the Communist era are still in the Brandenburg Prison. Martin Schulz is being released today. Have you got everything? Off you go! Good luck! See you, Martin. Your driver\\'s license, your ID and your wallet. And your money. Please sign here. So Mr. Schulz, here\\'s your release allowance of 800 marks, a train ticket to Berlin, and your release certificate. You must contact your probation officer in Berlin. I\\'m sure you know that. Papers are there, too. If you could just sign here. SEASON TICKET AMOUNT: DM 79.00 STANDARD FARE AMOUNT: DM 3.90 Hello, may I help you? Uhm ... yes. I want a present for my son. How old is your son? - Eleven. What does he like? - He ... - What are his hobbies? Hobbies ... Yes ... What\\'s he like doing? Well ... When you ask me like that ... I don\\'t know what he does or what his hobbies are. But it should be something modern. I saw an ad for it. It\\'s something where you press with both hands ... A Gameboy? But not a Tamagotchi. I saw a TV program on it. I reckon they\\'re absurd. Feeding an electronic pet seems warped to me. No, it\\'s something you have to press with both hands. Perhaps just a football is better. Um, hello. Is this where the Schulzes live? - Yes, it says so there. Oh, yes. And are you Rokko? - Yes. Is your mother home? - No, at work, and then she wanted to go shopping. Shopping. Actually I just wanted to drop off a few presents. My mother says I\\'m not allowed to let strangers in. Your mother\\'s quite right. Then I\\'ll just put everything in front of the door. By the way, the little package is for you. Thank you. OK. Goodbye, Rokko. Piss off! Piss off, I said. Leave me alone! Piss off! Piss off, I\\'m going to jump. Leave me alone. Piss off, I said. Clear off! Piss off! It\\'s at least a 15 meter jump. 2 or 3 seconds, and you\\'re gone. But if you jump, then ... ...I\\'ll jump, too. -Piss off! Piss off! Leave me alone! Are you crazy? Don\\'t you recognize me? Piss off! Leave me alone! Calm down. Calm down. Martin! Martin! What\\'s wrong with you, what\\'s wrong? After reunification, I went over to the West, to a building site in Stuttgart. Are you from East Germany? Eastie, can you lift this? Over there, their own people come first, then Giuseppe, then Achmed, then \"Easties\" right at the bottom. \"Eastie\"! I couldn\\'t take it, and came back to Berlin. I worked a while as a floorer ... ... now they say interior designer. And then I wanted to set up on my own. That was all so complicated. My last job was as an \"ice-man\". Frozen goods. An \"ice-man\". \"Ice is Nice\" was written on the van. I got my truck license specially. Then I forgot to shut the back, and all the stuff fell out on the street. That was it. Then you sit with a woman in a pub, and she asks what you do for a living. And I say nothing, simply nothing. You know how women are. If you have nothing, you are nothing. Yes ... and then I thought, \"I\\'ll jump off the roof and put an end to my misery\". But I didn\\'t even manage that. I\\'m not even capable of that. Do you have a handkerchief? Martin? Could you give us two beers, Ute? - I won\\'t do it on tab anymore. I\\'ll pay, OK? Thanks, Martin. And what\\'s Manfred doing? Haven\\'t seen him for ages. And Enrique? Haven\\'t seen him for ages either. Well, if it isn\\'t Mr. Pau! What a surprise! - Kurt, if you want to make trouble, get out. - Don\\'t interfere get me a beer. When do I see my money again? Do you owe him money? - Yes. Who\\'s this here? We don\\'t like tourists here, do you? -How much d\\'you owe him? - 300 marks. Here, take your dosh and get out. Is Daddy paying for you? OK, the Party thanks you. Have you been in a gay bar, meeting such generous people? Piss off! Come on, get out of here! Listen here! Don\\'t try talking to me like that, you motherfucker. You alright? - Yeah, I\\'m alright. We could go to my place. You can sleep over. - No, I\\'m OK. I\\'ll be off. Go home. Martin? Despite being almost totally submerged, they can breathe, smell, see and hear. They sink down silently, their lungs holding enough air for 5 minutes. Buoyancy and gravity are more or less equal. Above water, there\\'s turmoil again. Hippopotamuses are known for their aggression. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth are dangerous weapons, but most scuffles end peacefully. Martin! What a surprise! But why the TV? Why didn\\'t you leave it for the others? They\\'ve all got one. I brought your picture, too. Two jailbirds sat before the bank, one was smelly, the other stank. Then Smelly said to Stank: I\\'ll sit in front of another bank. What\\'s it mean? - It\\'s poetry. No, Victor, it\\'s shit. - It\\'s not shit. Hubes got 3 years more. He tried it on with a social worker. And Bucki? - Still the warders\\' best friend. And Ralli ... ... is in the looney bin. He lost it a few months ago. He kept hitting his head against the wall. They just took him away. But he had life anyway. And you? Any plans? Well ... ... to slowly get back into things. My wife\\'s with another guy ... - You knew that! Yes, I knew, but it\\'s still strange seeing her with someone else. And your son? At least I\\'ve seen him for the first time. And you? Porn? I\\'m ... I\\'m in retirement, Martin. I see nothing, I hear nothing! Do you want to go in? For you it\\'s free. Live show! Have you been here before? Or ... is it your first time? Do you like it? Shall I ... ... tell you my prices? One ... two ... three. Can you speak Russian? I understand ... a little. Where did you learn? Are you from ... ... East Germany? My mother ... was ... a Russian teacher ... in an East German school. I\\'m not stupid, little soldier. Good morning, Mr. Schulz. Oh, sorry, did we wake you? - Yes We\\'re from the Berlin News. We chose your address at random, and would like to do a short interview. May we come in? Thank you. Do you like it? - Nice. A bit big, maybe. Here\\'s information on opening a savings account, this is to help you find an apartment, here are job center addresses, something on health and pension schemes, and here\\'s your new tax card. An application for social welfare. A job training program is also possible. And I\\'ve also prepared an application for supervised lodgings. I\\'d rather stay in the hotel, and find work myself. That\\'s alright. But you\\'ll have to come here regularly so we can monitor progress. I recommend our workshops. I take the art therapy, and would love to see you there. Take a look at the pictures on the wall. Now you can see when it\\'s our turn. We\\'ve 345, and it\\'s showing 325. So there are 20 people to go. Do I need my passport? - Of course. Here\\'s the Berlin News\\' card. They asked where I was when the Wall came down. Here, look. They should\\'ve asked me. Do you know where I was? No. - Didn\\'t I write? - No. I was sitting in a tank. The T72. Not an animal, not a man, but an armored infantryman. That was October \\'89, with the demos on the Alexanderplatz. We all knew what was up. We had to give blood. They asked for our blood groups. We gave blood and got in the tanks. The square was full. I wouldn\\'t have known what to do if we\\'d mobilized. You couldn\\'t talk, the Stasi were always there. They\\'d have let us fire, like in China. And me in a T72! Profession? - Engine fitter. Where did you train? - Karl Liebknecht transformer works. What was your last place of employment? Where was your last place of employment? In Brandenburg. -With What firm? In the metalworking shop of the Brandenburg Penitentiary. Floorer, interior designer. You can\\'t call me at home, because I\\'m in a telephone box. But you can call me here. The number is 4-6-7-2-3-9-8. Yes, goodbye. Yes, I\\'m a fitter. Of course I\\'ve got experience. The last thing I did was installation work abroad. Ringing me at home is difficult, but you can get me in this telephone box. I\\'ll wait for your call. The number is 4-6-7-2-3-9-8. 4-6-7... ... hello? Hello? - What\\'s wrong? - Hung up. Hello. Hello. I thought ... ... I\\'d just come ... ... to see how you are. You\\'re looking good. Thanks. You, too. What are you doing tonight? Today\\'s bad, we\\'ve got visitors. Perhaps we could ... Wait. Here\\'s a visiting card from work. My telephone number\\'s on it. You can ring me there. I mean ... ... we could organize something. It\\'d be nice if you rang. \\x96 OK. See you. Martin? Don\\'t you want to come in? Yes. ... and then we go to Spain or Portugal. This is Martin, an old friend. Martin. - Petra. Pierre. \\x96 Pierre? Pierre. Wolfgang. Martin. Take a seat. Can I offer you a drink? - Yes. I won\\'t say no. I\\'ll bring a glass. Are you hungry? What is it? - Paella. It\\'s Spanish. Thanks. Thanks. Tastes good. Tastes really good. Nothing beats watching other people eat, does it? Are you finished? - Yes. Superb. - Thanks. Thanks. You too? Where do you all come from? I\\'m from South Germany, like Wolfgang. I only know South Germany from TV. Wolfgang and I... ... studied together. Oh, did you? And you? - I\\'m from near Marseilles. Marseilles. France. Only seen that on TV too. Where the bottle once was full now stands a coffin. Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin. -Cheers! Cheers! Are you a writer? - Me? No. Not me. I just had a lot of time to read. I liked the Russians best, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Pushkin. They\\'ve no idea about politics, but they can really write. Is he a writer? - No, I asked if he was, but ... Manuela? Rokko\\'s already in bed, I suppose. Yes. He went to bed a quarter of an hour ago. Thank you. No, no need. I don\\'t light them. -But you can smoke here. No, I don\\'t smoke anymore. -What do You mean? It comes with time. I haven\\'t for years. I\\'d like to ask you something. You\\'re from East Germany, too. What were you doing when the Wall came down? Sorry ... ... I\\'m so curious, but ... ... I always find the stories so exciting. Do you really want to know? - Yes. I was in the army. National People\\'s Army. Armored division. Not an animal, not a man, but an armored infantryman. All my friends were in the streets. My wife was pregnant with our son. And I sat in a tank waiting for the order to move in. It was terrible. The hospitals stocked up on blood. The soldiers had to donate blood. You couldn\\'t say anything, because someone from the Stasi was always there. Anyway ... I got up, and said, \"Do what you want, but I\\'m not shooting at my wife. I\\'ll take the tank ... and drive it into a tree\". What do we do now? Can you be quieter? - Yes, but what should we do? What do you want to do? - I\\'d send for a taxi right away. No way. What do you mean, \"no way\"? OK, then I\\'ll just go to bed. Why aren\\'t you sleeping? I did some English homework. You were all so loud. Good. But that\\'s enough now. It\\'s late. Sleep well. Wouldn\\'t it be better to lock the bedrooms? With your husband here. -Don\\'t start that again. He seems so strange. I know you lost contact with him, but He looks like he just got out of jail. I\\'m sorry. I haven\\'t anything against him. But it\\'s weird how he just turned up ...- Martin. He really has just got out of jail. How do you know that? I always have. He went to jail in July 1989. Before the Wall came down. We had just married, and I was pregnant with Rokko. It all started in the spring of 1989. I was at home on my own. The doorbell rang. Is your husband home, Mrs. Schulz? - No, he\\'s at work. I\\'ve found an irregularity in the list of occupants of this house. Two weeks ago you had West Germans here. But you didn\\'t register them in the house list. But why? They were friends of friends, and we registered them with the police. Please write the names and addresses of your visitors in the list. So that\\'s done. Now for another delicate matter. I found something in your cellar that really worries me. Mrs. Schulz, I\\'m worried about your husband. You know it\\'s really my duty to put these things into the right hands. I don\\'t need to tell you that crossing the border illegally is an offence. Mrs. Schulz, I only want to help. -He had us in his power. - Go away! And I was scared. Simply scared. Actually ... I didn\\'t want to tell Martin the whole story. I shouldn\\'t have told him. I simply shouldn\\'t have told him. What happened then? When I ... When I visited Martin in jail, he told me that he ... ... counted his steps until he arrived. He kept wondering whether to turn back. Where are my things? Mr. Schulz! It could look bad for you if your equipment got into the wrong hands. I want my things. It\\'d be better to let me and the authorities deal with it. Give them to me! - Mr. Schulz, I only want to help you. I talked it over with your wife. We talked about your class attitudes. - Give me my things! We can talk about everything, class attitudes, solidarity ... ... but give me back my things. My name is rokko shultz I am a boy from Berlin Berlin is in Germany What brings you here at this hour? I need somewhere to sleep. In 1974, what song won the ...? Wolfgang! -Waterloo? - Eurovision prize. What author gave his name to the literature prize Cologne has been awarding since ... Andreas! - Heinrich Böll? - Yes! Good night. - Good night. What German city has the number plate HRO? Rostock? - Yes ... Good morning. - Morning. Thanks. THE LAST EASTIE I\\'ve got a question about an article in your local section. Yes, about that man. Can you tell me in what hotel he\\'s in? Oh. Then I\\'ll come by. Is my ID enough? See you soon. Bye. Your husband\\'s left. Oh. Did he tell you where he was going? - No. I\\'ve even got his stuff here. You can have it if you pay his bills. Your husband talked about you a lot. When did you lose contact? Years ago, wasn\\'t it? Yes. He didn\\'t want me to come anymore. Why wasn\\'t I told of his release? You have to apply for that yourself. We can\\'t do everything. \\x96 Oh. Has he already visited you? Yes, briefly. He came at a bad moment. I\\'ll be frank with you. Your husband\\'s case is special. He isn\\'t a criminal, and his offence ... ... was unusual. But a long sentence always has the same effects. He\\'ll get in touch after a success or a disappointment. If he can\\'t cope at first, he\\'ll need your help. You shouldn\\'t promise him too much. That could make him overreact if he\\'s disappointed. But don\\'t apply for divorce or withdraw custody of his son yet. That would be too much for him. He needs you, but he also has to become independent. He didn\\'t say anything. I said he could stay here but he didn\\'t want to. Then he said he\\'d be in touch. Nothing about his plans? No. Not a word. Maybe he\\'s gone on holiday. You never know with Martin. Here are the keys ... ... to get in, for the till, and so on. I don\\'t know if this is my thing. What? I bust a gut getting you a job, and it\\'s not good enough for you? Have you got a better one? Don\\'t think about what you shouldn\\'t do. Think about what you should do. Dolores from Cuba, Lee from Hong Kong, Magda from the Czech Republic, Asye from Turkey, Petra from Lichtenberg ... Well, hello! Why are you here? He\\'s going to work and live here. - I\\'m just helping out. You mostly have late shift, don\\'t you? - Leiwand! Clever boy, aren\\'t you! I thought she was Russian. - \"Leiwand!\" \"Totally leiwand!\" That\\'s the way they talk in Vienna. Leiwand. Natasha, live show! What about the door? - Oh, yes. Natasha, it\\'s a couple. I\\'d like Natasha, please. OK. Natasha, live show. Sorry. Well? Have you already finished? - Yes. Tell me ... Why do you pretend to be Russian when you aren\\'t? It sells better. Oh. What\\'s your real name? Guess. Erika? I don\\'t know. What could your name be? Andrea? No, come on. Wait, wait ... Ursel? No way! - Mata Hari? Oh, please! - She was a dancer! You\\'re being dumb. - Then tell me! Ludmila. Ludmila. Ludmila. - Nice Name. Thanks. How much? Enrique? Martin? How long\\'ve you been out? How\\'re you doing? - Pretty well. And you? - Fine. My old pal! And Gisela? Still around? Of course. Here she is with my son. It\\'s amazing seeing you again. Unbelievable. Take care. \\x96 Thanks. See you. - See you. See you. \\x96 Goodbye A former colleague of mine. Where do we go now? How many students live here? - No idea. 200? I don\\'t have any contact. It\\'s all pretty anonymous here. The exchange program pays for the apartment. That\\'s why I\\'m here. It\\'s cheaper, you see? And where exactly do you come from? Do you really want to know? OK. Well ... ... my mother comes from Skopje in Macedonia, my father from Kiev in the Ukraine. I was born in Belgrade, grew up in Zagreb, and then I went to Vienna. That\\'s pretty complicated. Complicated. So how\\'s things? Hey! - Hey, Martin! Hey! I keep getting extra games. By the way, Manuela visited me. What? Manuela came to see you? - Yeah. She asked for you. Watch, Martin! Oh, isn\\'t that cool? Listen to that! Martin! I\\'ve made a mint! 280, 290, 300 marks. And the bag\\'s for free. Great! Know who I saw? - Who? - Enrique. Enrique? Haven\\'t seen him for ages. I\\'d like to see him again. What\\'s he up to? Do you have his number? What, you\\'ve got a mobile? - Yeah. An investment, Martin. No more telephone boxes for me! 18... - Yes. 20... - Yes. 2...3...4... 7... -Yes. 30... -Yes. Gone. I\\'ve got nothing again. - You\\'re holding back again. I\\'ll discard you ... and you. We\\'re playing grand, friends. With grand you play your aces or shut your faces. Man, has he got luck! I\\'d like a hand like that! If it goes on like this, we\\'ll be poor. Look what I\\'ve brought. Martin, that\\'s you. Till and Manfred. Peter, that\\'s you. - Me? Yes.. And this is me ... the mandatory Cuban How long ago was that? \\'86, \\'87? - Yes. You were still young and beautiful! Good for a medal! 18. - Yes. 20. - Yes. 22. - Yes. Gone. - Go on. ..0. - Yes. 24... 27... - Yes. 30? - Yes. Peter! 33... 35... 36... What\\'s a nigger doing on your balcony, Peter? Stop yelling, we\\'re playing skat. Let\\'s have a look at you, nigger! Isn\\'t that the guy from the pub? - Yes. Watch it or we\\'ll come over! Are they sick? They\\'re just kids. Are we going to stand for this? - No, I don\\'t think we are. I\\'ll hold the fort, OK? You lot are in for it now! No more \"uuh uuh uuh\"! Good stuff! Get \\'em! Yes! Look out, Martin! Good, Enrique! What do you want with that? - You know, Martin ... ... some guys run around with guns. As a taxi driver, you\\'ve got to watch it. Get in. This is some car! Can I drive? Top left. Hand brake. On the left ... ... clutch, in the middle ... brake, on the right ... accelerator. Like in the East. - Like in the East. Oh, a lovely sound! Now press the accelerator gently. Daring, Mr. Wenz, very daring. Did you see your father? - Yes. - Good. Yesterday. I can go, can\\'t I? - Yes. Ciao. How\\'s it looking, Mr. Schulz? Wow, great! Really great! Your wife came to inquire about you. Aren\\'t you in the hotel anymore? Manuela? What did she want? She asked where you\\'re living. While you\\'re under supervision you must always tell us your address. I\\'m staying with Peter Pau. I\\'ll give you the address. Make sure you do. - Yes. - Good. Why were you in the same jail? I\\'ll tell you why. In 1990 after the reunification, I did a bank job in the East. I was given years in Brandenburg jail... I\\'ve seen many jails ... in my life But I\\'ve never experienced something like Brandenburg When I came ... ... to our story, there was ... ... a white towel on the floor. A freshly laundered white towel. All the prisoners stood there, Martini as well. I was just about ... to step over the towel. But that seemed too much bother. And with my dirty shoes, I trod right on top of the towel. That was the \"towel test\". If you trod on it, you were OK, if you didn\\'t, they had it in for you. What did you do? Me? Well ... ... I saw the towel, picked it up, and asked who\\'d lost their towel. Like that. Is that Rokko? - Yes. He\\'s just as small as I was. - Then you were really small. Did you see? That\\'s Manuela\\'s new boyfriend. He\\'s a teacher. What a shit! Hello. Hello. I\\'d like to book a trip. I want to find out what sorts of things are available. Aha. Where do you want to go? I don\\'t know. What\\'s on offer? Far away destinations are very popular. Venezuela, Mexico, Australia, - Australia. Australia\\'s good. Australia. You can fly to Sydney or Melbourne. It\\'d be best to book for the school holidays so my son can come along. Why would I go to Australia on my own? My idea is to do my taxi license ... You drive a taxi? - Yes, the test\\'s soon, and when I get the job, I want to see Rokko. To collect him at school in the taxi. One day he\\'ll ask who his dad is anyway. But Rokko\\'s 11 - I know how old my son is. I don\\'t want to interfere with your life. But I waited 11 years for one thing. I want to see my son. And for him to know who his dad is. Having a cabby as dad\\'s OK, isn\\'t it? As usual there are questions on streets and buildings and so on. Yes ... the test\\'s in the registration office. You from Berlin? - Yes, so to speak. Then it shouldn\\'t be a problem. Have you got someone to test you and help you learn? Yes, my wife. Then we\\'ll put you down for the test. So, my friend. All of this by heart. That\\'s hard. So ... Lenin Square ... no, United Nations Square ... ... into Friedensstrasse, then up Greifswalderstrasse, left into Dimitroffstrasse, is now Danzigerstrasse, then right at Schönhauser Allee, then left into Schivelbeinerstrasse ... - Wait! Once Willi Bredel Strasse. Schivelbeinerstrasse, then onto Helmut Just Strasse, now has a different name ... - Behmstrasse. Behmstrasse. Who thought of that? So anyway, Behmstrasse, then up Norwegerstrasse, and there\\'s Bornholmerstrasse Station. You\\'re good at the East. Just forget the old names. Let\\'s do a route in the West. Ruhleben to Heerstrasse Station. That\\'s easy. Reichstrasse, Reichsportfeldstrasse, Theodor Heuss Square, Heerstrasse, and the station\\'s on your left. Good. Hello. - Hi. - Your taxi? Yes, almost. It belongs to a friend, but soon I\\'ll have my own. Is Rokko in? Come in, I\\'ll open the door. This is where I can buy players and ... ... sell players. Now I\\'ll play a game. Now I can pick the players, but I never play myself. Haven\\'t you any influence? I can put on substitutes, but that\\'s all. Here you can see what day the game\\'s on, and here\\'s when the next game is. But I don\\'t have a game every time. But now I have one. We\\'ll play this one? Go on. OK. I can change the team. I can say that the ... ... trainer selects, and I\\'m the manager. Players are on offer. Make a bid for ... How much does, say, Meisner cost? But this is cool, isn\\'t it? Yes, natch ... Natch? - Naturally. Martin? Could you come here, please? Yes, natch. Wolfgang will be home soon. I don\\'t think it\\'s good if you\\'re here. Why\\'s that? It\\'s a nice big house. Enough chairs. So many rooms you can\\'t use them all. I\\'ll move in. Enough food, too. Ménage á trois. It\\'s a bit loud. If I had my way, travel would be banned again. OK, I\\'ll be on my way. I have to take Enrique his taxi anyway. I\\'ll ring to tell you how the test was. And then we\\'ll talk to Rocco, OK? Bye, Manu. Bye. Goodbye, Mr ... Bye. See you, Rokko! Hello. I was just at the bank, and I tell you it\\'d be child\\'s play. With two people you\\'d need 3 minutes. We go in, take a hostage, and walk to the safe in our own time. In the East it\\'s all changed. Fritz Heckert Strasse is Engeldamm, Ho Chi Min Strasse is Weissenseerweg. It\\'s really hard work. It\\'s ages since I\\'ve been in a bank with such good vibes. You can feel when luck is in the air, and you only have to grab for it. Can you tell me how they could change Helmut Just Strasse to Behmstrasse? Hey, are you listening? - No, I\\'m trying not to. Martini, things aren\\'t going so well, and I have to ... ... think of something. - I\\'m not here much longer, whether things are good or bad. I wanted to suggest you change your name anyway, maybe ... ... Thorsten instead of Victor. But Victor is a good name. Why should I call myself Thorsten? You don\\'t have to ... oh, never mind! Hello? Is Victor there? No. Can I help you? I\\'m looking for videos. The whole shop\\'s full of them. You just have to pick one. What is it you want? Otto Grotewohl Strasse turns into Wilhelmstrasse. Ludmila, could you come here, please? Victor\\'s not back yet. I have to go to my test. Go on then, I\\'ll close the shop. OK. Martin. Good luck. You can do it. Mr. Schulz, ...could you come? -I\\'m not through. Yes, but ... ... please come with me. What\\'s wrong? Mr. Schulz, we check each applicant\\'s police record. Unfortunately we found that you were convicted of a serious offence. The guidelines regarding applicants for a taxi license exclude anyone convicted of a serious offence. What\\'s wrong? Martin, tell us what\\'s up! Martini, you think you\\'re the only one things don\\'t work out for. Haven\\'t you any grit? - You\\'re getting on my nerves. You\\'ll be in jail again soon anyway. You mess things up and are proud of it. That\\'s enough ... - Shut up! Do you think I\\'m blind? That I don\\'t know what you\\'re selling under the counter? People like you should be hanged! - Pull yourself together! See you. I\\'d hang people like you. A nice thick rope and that\\'s that. Leave the shop in one piece. So, some tomato ... ... that\\'s always ... ... very important, tomato or peppers. Hello? Is anyone there? Good evening. Police. We\\'ve got a search warrant for your shop. Are you the owner? I only help out. Bingo! Behind the counter! What\\'s wrong? What\\'s the time? - Half past. Why? Martin had his test. He was going to ring. Don\\'t look like that. Why not? I\\'ll look how I like. You\\'re making a fool of yourself! Let me go. Hey! Are you crazy? Open the door! Wolfgang, let me out! Are you mad? Open the door and let me out! Open the door! I want to see Manuela. - Sorry ... ... but Manuela\\'s at her mother\\'s. And where\\'s Rokko ? He\\'s with her. What\\'s going on? I can hear Manuela. Go away! Manuela! Go or I\\'ll call the police. Police? Leonhardt Frank Strasse. We\\'ve got a burglar. Come quickly! My name is Riedel. Leonhard Frank Strasse in Pankow. There\\'s only one of them . Open the door! Let me out! Are you mad? - The guy outside\\'s the problem. You\\'re the problem! - He\\'ll break the windows! Martin! What\\'s wrong? Wait. I\\'ll get dressed and come out. What\\'s going on? Go to your room. I\\'ll tell you later. What\\'s up? - I\\'ve got hassles, and I told you to go to your room. - But what\\'s wrong? Oh boy! Come here. Police! Police! Hands up! - Out of there! Hands up! I want your hands up! Come out! - I haven\\'t done anything! Both hands! - I haven\\'t done anything! Car calling HQ. - HQ here. - Last name Schulz with a \"z\". Born 22.5.64 in Berlin. First name Martin. Don\\'t worry. Everything\\'s alright. But ... why are you here? He hasn\\'t done anything. Why did you ring us, then? I didn\\'t. He is my husband. Let him out! Rolf? This looks like another family drama. Let\\'s go. Watch out! He\\'s had a conviction and he\\'s wanted. Bring him in. What\\'s wrong now? Open the door! Let him out! No, let me go! Are you mad or something? - Go away! Martin, come out! Bloody pigs! Martin! Mr. Schulz, you\\'ve had a conviction for murder, after the reunification it was changed to manslaughter. When did you first go to prison? - It\\'s all in my file. I don\\'t know ... Answer my question. When was it? It was before reunification. I was sentenced in the summer of 1989 in Berlin. Manuela and I wanted to get out of East Germany. East Germany was ... - You don\\'t have to tell me about East Germany. What had you done? I killed our house administrator, but I didn\\'t mean to, I flipped. It was a fluke. It says here You beat him to death. Is that a fluke? The People\\'s Police made the report ... - The autopsy report confirms it. They did what they liked with people who wanted to escape. You know that. I can see you were one of them, too. - Don\\'t get insolent! How do you know Victor Valentin? We were both in Brandenburg Prison. Was he your friend? - My friend? Was there a sexual relationship? No. And you knew nothing about what was sold under the counter? No. That was also a \"fluke\". - I didn\\'t do anything! Can you tell us where he is? No. - Mr. Schulz. I\\'ll read you Section 184, paragraph 4 of the Criminal Code. If the offender acts for gain or as part of a group, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of 6 months to 10 years, in addition to your probation. Are you scared of Mr. Valentin\\'s testimony? I didn\\'t do anything! Where did you learn these methods? In the Stasi? Listen here. There are places ... ... where they hang people like you. I know guys like you. I\\'ve met enough. Bit boring now, eh? No electric shocks, no padded cells. What a shit! Mr. Schulz? - Yes? I\\'m not from the East. I\\'m from Bremen. I\\'ve brought you some things. Look. \"Dear Dad, you have to jump over the snakes, and watch out for the monkeys. Love from Rokko.\" It\\'s not looking good. They want to get me with this. I can\\'t go through that again. Why did you get involved with Victor Valentin? You knew he wasn\\'t good to be around. And the taxi license! I could have told you you needed a special report. You can get the license, but only when you\\'ve settled down, and another offence is unlikely. I can organize a special report so you can take the test ... So? Martin... ... old Eastie, did you think I\\'d leave you in the lurch? I gave myself up. Do you think 5 years more or less make any difference to me? Bring me my TV when you\\'ve time. And send my love to your wife. Don\\'t think about... ... what you shouldn\\'t do, Martini. Think about what you should do. So, here... and here.

You\\'re a bum! Strike! You\\'re out! Elmer, here it is. - I knew you\\'d find it. - Boy, I could sure use a drink. I wonder if any big shots are getting married today? Looks like the same suckers get married every day. Come on. Hey, the guy with the cheaters. Now what\\'s he hiding from? - Hey, isn\\'t that Mortimer Brewster? - Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic? No, it\\'s not him. But what a scoop it\\'d be! The guy who wrote The Bachelor\\'s Bible getting hooked. It\\'s too good to be true. Let\\'s snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go. Let\\'s stick around, see who the guy is. \"Two by two they come and go\" Good morning, children. Your name, please? - Elaine Harper. - Speak a little louder. Elaine Harper. Thank you. Yours? - Mortimer Brewster. - How\\'s that? Mortimer Brewster. Speak up, sonny. There\\'s nothing to be afraid of. I want to keep this undercover. Love her? Of course you love her. You\\'re marrying her, right? You don\\'t understand. Come here. I don\\'t want this to get out for a while. I\\'m Mortimer Brewster. You\\'re who? Mortimer Brew... That\\'s him! Mr. Brewster! Now, look... Goodbye, dear. Don\\'t you understand? How can I marry you? Me, the symbol of bachelorhood. I\\'ve sneered at every love scene. I\\'ve written four million words against marriage! Not only hooked, but to a minister\\'s daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn. Look at the way you look! What is that contraption you\\'ve got there? A pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know, \"Something borrowed... \" I know, \"Something borrowed, something blue\". Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold. Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe. Is this what I\\'ve come to? I can\\'t go through with it. I won\\'t marry you. That\\'s that. - Yes, Mortimer. - What do you mean, \"Yes, Mortimer\"? Aren\\'t you insulted? Aren\\'t you going to cry? - No, Mortimer. - And don\\'t \"No, Mortimer\" me, either! Marriage is a superstition. It\\'s old-fashioned. It\\'s... O\\'Hara, don\\'t be a jerk. You don\\'t realize... ...I\\'m turning over to you the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn. Now look at that old church. And them old houses. Did George Washington ever sleep here? Of course he did. This whole neighborhood just stinks with atmosphere. - And look at that old house. - The original owners still there? Don\\'t crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They\\'re two of the dearest, sweetest old ladies that ever walked the earth. They\\'re out of this world. They\\'re like pressed rose leaves. Pressed rose leaves? The old girls must be kind of hard up. Their old man left them fixed for life. Don\\'t you call them \"the girls,\" either. Brophy. Is Lieutenant around? So what are they renting rooms for? They don\\'t. But you can bet if anybody came looking for a room... ...they wouldn\\'t go away without a good meal and a couple of bucks. That\\'s their way of digging up people to do good to. Reverend Harper, I do hope you don\\'t disapprove of Mortimer... ...because he\\'s a dramatic critic and takes your daughter to the theater. It\\'s not that I disapprove of his being a critic... ...but no man with this published attitude... ...should take any man\\'s daughter anyplace, at any time. I must be catching cold. No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed. Bless you. We mustn\\'t be angry with Mortimer. He\\'s so very much in love with her. Sister Martha and I are so happy. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now... ...he\\'s in Brooklyn six nights a week. Remember now, watch your language. You know I\\'m not a swearing man. You\\'d be surprised what they\\'d consider swearing. Will you excuse me? No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I\\'ll go. - Come right in, Mr. Brophy. - Miss Abby, we came for the toys. This is Officer O\\'Hara. He\\'s taking over my beat. - How do you do, miss? - Welcome to our neighborhood. Gentlemen, what news have you brought me? Colonel, we have nothing to report. No, absolutely nothing to report. Splendid! Thank you, gentlemen. At ease. You know the Reverend Dr. Harper from the church next door? Hello. This is Officer O\\'Hara, the new man on the beat. How do you do, sir? It\\'s nice to meet you. The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door. Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your Army and Navy from Aunt Martha\\'s room. They\\'re all packed. That\\'s splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys for the kids at camp. Charge! It gives us something to do at the station. You get tired of playing cards. - So these are the toys? - How\\'s Mrs. Brophy? She\\'s better, thank you. But a little weak, still. I\\'ll get some beef broth for you to take to her. Please don\\'t bother. You\\'ve done so much already. Stop the nonsense! I won\\'t be a minute. Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute generosity are... ...it\\'s because I\\'ve known the Brewster sisters. Teddy, you promised me you wouldn\\'t do that anymore. But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get those supplies. Now don\\'t do that again. Do you hear me? He used to do that at night... ...and the neighbors raised Cain. They\\'re afraid of him. Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn\\'t swear, but what the heck... What\\'s going on here? - He\\'s quite harmless. - He thinks he\\'s Teddy Roosevelt. There\\'s a lot of worse guys he could think he was. That\\'s right. I\\'ll make a note. He\\'s an interesting character. Isn\\'t it a shame, Father... Isn\\'t it a shame, Reverend, that this nice family should be hatching a cuckoo? Well, now, isn\\'t this nice! - Good afternoon, Miss Brewster. - How do you do? - Good afternoon. - Reverend, how do you do? Miss Martha, Officer O\\'Hara. He\\'s taking over my duties. How do you do? - I\\'m very glad to know you. - Thank you. Martha, you\\'re back. Here\\'s the broth for Mrs. Brophy. Be sure it\\'s good and hot. You bet I will, and thank you very much. The Army and Navy are ready for action. Colonel, this is grand. It\\'ll make a lot of kids happy. What\\'s this? The Oregon? Teddy, dear, put it back. - But the Oregon goes to Australia. - Now, Teddy... No, it goes to Australia. - These are lovely. Thank you. - Not at all. - The children will go crazy. - Don\\'t mention it. So long, Colonel. Hey, Sarge. Yes. Dismissed! - Goodbye and thank you. - Don\\'t mention it. - Careful of the step with the toys. - Good night. Young man, let that be a lesson to you. Goodbye. - Well, I must be going. - Charge! Charge the blockhouse! Blockhouse? The stairs are always San Juan Hill. Bless you! Have you tried to persuade him he wasn\\'t Roosevelt? - Oh, no! - He\\'s so happy being Teddy Roosevelt. Do you remember, Martha? Once, a long time ago, we thought if he\\'d be George Washington... ...it might be a change for him, and we suggested it. And do you know what happened? He just stayed under his bed for days and wouldn\\'t be anybody. Well, if he\\'s happy, and what\\'s more important, you\\'re happy... Our only worry for Teddy is after we\\'re gone. Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem. Mortimer\\'s made all the arrangements for Teddy... ...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on. Splendid idea! A very pleasant place. Dear, sweet Reverend Harper. You know, Martha, I do believe he\\'s beginning to see the light. I\\'m sure we needn\\'t worry about him. He won\\'t interfere with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine. Did you just have tea? Yes. And dinner\\'s going to be late, too. So, why? Good news for you. You\\'re going to Panama and dig another lock for the canal. Delighted! That\\'s bully! Just bully! I shall prepare at once for the journey. Charge! Abby! While I was out? Yes, dear. I just couldn\\'t wait for you. I didn\\'t know when you\\'d be back, and Reverend Harper was coming. - But all by yourself. - I got along fine. - I\\'ll run right downstairs and see. - No, dear. There wasn\\'t time. And I was all alone. Well? Just look in the windowseat. - It\\'s Elaine! - Hello, darlings. - But, Elaine! - What did she mean? You don\\'t suppose they\\'ve gone and... Listen, buddy. - This old cab has seen osculation but... - You ain\\'t seen anything yet. - You\\'ve got to drive us to the station. - Take her hat. Wait a minute. And her brooch. If you find her hairpins, keep them. Hold on to that. There they are. Here\\'s your hat. Just throw it. I don\\'t like that look in your eyes. - What\\'s the matter with it? - Father preached about it only last Sunday. He did? What did he say? - He was against it. - But that was only Sunday. Please! For heaven\\'s sake! But, Mortimer, right out here with everyone looking? Yes, right out here with everyone looking. Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look. But, Mortimer, you\\'re going to love me for my mind, too? One thing at a time. There\\'s that look again! \"There\\'s that look again, Mortimer! \" You better get used to it. You\\'ll see it often. It goes just before this. You know what we\\'re doing? Wasting time. I\\'ll go tell my aunts and you tell your... No, don\\'t tell your father. You\\'ll run his cold into a pneumonia. I can handle Father. He\\'s a dear. Look, why don\\'t we wire him from Niagara Falls? Niagara Falls? That\\'s why you stopped at your office. Yes, certainly! We\\'re going to go the whole hog. Niagara Falls! Everybody ought to go there. You should\\'ve seen my secretary\\'s face. We\\'ve a room on the train, the bridal suite in the hotel... ...and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel. Go on, darling, hurry and pack. I don\\'t have to. I started packing the day after I met you. There, you see! You see? That\\'s what I mean. That\\'s what I hate about women. I wonder what Mary\\'s doing now? - The train leaves in an hour, hurry. - It\\'ll be a few minutes. - Father may want to pray over me. - Whistle when you\\'re ready. When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a tall, dark streak of light, it\\'s me. What? Now? No, not now! Look surprised when he tells us. Hold on to your bustles. We\\'re married. Elaine and I are married. Oh, darling, how wonderful! Isn\\'t it wonderful? They\\'re married! Don\\'t pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds. - Can I use the telephone? - Of course. Isn\\'t it too, too wonderful? And to think that it happened right here in this room! Now, here. Benson\\'s Florists? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those roses to Mrs. Brewster? Good. Send four dozen more to drawing room A, Grand Central Station. Hurry. And throw in a flock of orange blossoms. But before you go, we can have our celebration. I\\'ll open a bottle of wine and we\\'ll sing. And we\\'ll invite a few neighbors in. - And, of course, a wedding cake. - You won\\'t have time to bake a cake. We\\'re going to Niagara Falls. A taxi\\'s waiting. It\\'s all ready. It\\'s been ready since... I bet it\\'s been ready since the first day I met her. Did everybody know I was getting married, except me? We knew you\\'d find out about it in time. I\\'ve got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of course, you\\'ve got the nicest nephew in the world, too. Well, I\\'ll run along and get everything ready. Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn\\'t too angry. You know how your books upset him. I\\'m going to burn all my books. I\\'ll let the Reverend light the first match. Did I leave some notes here for my new book? You mean Mind Over Matrimony Where are they? - I hid them someplace... - Come along. Now you behave. Let\\'s find them before Elaine sees them. Hello, Mortimer! - How are you, Mr. President? - Bully, thank you. Just bully. - What news have you brought me? - The country\\'s squarely behind you. Yes, I know. Isn\\'t it wonderful? Well, goodbye. I\\'m off to Panama. Goodbye, Mr. President. A new lock for the canal, you know. \"Oh, tell the news to Mother\" - Oh, dear. - Find those notes? What\\'s wrong? There\\'s a baby picture of your brother Jonathan. You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a face! I remember now. He\\'d scare grownups with it. Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth? Jonathan? He\\'s probably in prison or hanged or something by now. I saw a play, had a character in it, reminded me of Jonathan. Really? A honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits called Murder Will Out. Oh, dear! Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first thing you see is a dead body. The next thing... Hey, mister. - Happy bridegroom! - Congratulations, darling! Never mind that now. Now, listen, darlings. You know how we\\'ve always planned to send Teddy to Happy Dale? Yes, dear. That\\'s after we\\'re gone. Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it. Teddy\\'s got to go to Happy Dale now. At once! - He\\'s in the cellar. Get him up here now. - There\\'s no such hurry as that. When Teddy\\'s working on the canal, you can\\'t get his mind on anything else. Well, look, darlings. I\\'m frightfully sorry, but I\\'ve got an awful shock for you. Teddy\\'s killed a man, darlings! Nonsense! There\\'s a body in the windowseat! Yes, dear. We know. - You know? - Of course. Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy. Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman. Forget? We never dreamed you\\'d peek. What the... Who is he? He\\'s a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That\\'s really all I know about him, except that he\\'s a Methodist. He\\'s a Methodist? Isn\\'t that nice. That\\'s all you know? What\\'s he doing here? - What happened to him? - He died. Aunt Martha, men just don\\'t get into windowseats and die. No, dear. He died first. Wait! Stop all this. Now look, how did he die? Mortimer, don\\'t be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. How did the poison get in the wine? We put it in wine because it\\'s less noticeable. When it\\'s in tea, it has a distinct odor. You mean you... You put it in the wine? Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins in the windowseat... ...because Reverend Harper was coming. Look at me, darling. You knew what you\\'d done and didn\\'t want Reverend Harper to see the body? Well, not at tea. That wouldn\\'t have been very nice. It\\'s first-degree. Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets. Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Mrs. Schultz. She\\'s much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the movies again. We must do that, tomorrow or next day. Yes, but this time we\\'ll go where we want to go. Junior\\'s not going to drag me into another one of those scary pictures. They ought not to be allowed to make pictures just to frighten people. Operator? Can you hear my voice? You can? Are you sure? Then I must be here. The dears. Isn\\'t Halloween a wonderful time for them? Yes, it is. They have so much fun. Now, Mortimer, don\\'t be so impatient. - We\\'ll let you lick the bowl. - Lick the bowl? I don\\'t want to. I want to know what we\\'re going to do! We\\'re going to celebrate. Celebrate? There\\'s a body in the windowseat! Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins. I know what his name is. I want to know what we\\'re going to do. - We can\\'t turn you over to the police. - Stop worrying about it. We told you to forget the whole thing. Forget? Can\\'t I make you realize that something has to be done? Now, Mortimer, you behave. You\\'re too old to be flying off the handle like this. - But Mr. Hodgekiss... - Hoskins, dear. Whatever his name is, you can\\'t leave him in there. We don\\'t intend to, dear. Teddy\\'s down in the cellar now, digging the lock. You\\'re going to bury Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar? Yes, dear. That\\'s what we did with the others. Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can\\'t... - Others? - The other gentlemen. When you say \"others,\" do you mean \"others\"? - More than one \"others\"? - Yes, dear. Let me see now. This is 11, isn\\'t it, Abby? No, dear. This makes 12. Abby, dear, I think you\\'re wrong. This one is only 11. No, dear, because I remember when Mr. Hoskins first came in... ...it occurred to me that he\\'d make just an even dozen. But, Abby, dear, I really don\\'t think you should count the first one. I was counting the first one, and that makes it 12. It does? Well, she\\'s probably right. Abby usually is. I get them mixed up sometimes. Makes it 12. Hello. Whatever is the matter with Mortimer today? Why, Abby, what do you think happened to him? Hello? Not now. For heaven\\'s sake, keep your shirt on! Elaine, I didn\\'t mean... Now, let\\'s see. Where were we? Twelve. Twelve! Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one. Never mind about that. Just sit down. Tell me, who was the first one? Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist. He was such a lonely, old gentleman. All his kith and kin were dead. We felt so sorry for him. And then, when his heart attack came... ...and he sat there dead in that chair... ...looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha? We made up our minds, then and there... ...that if we could help other lonely, old men... ...to find that same peace... ...we would. Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this chair? And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama... ...and he thought Mr. Midgely was a yellow-fever victim. And that meant he had to be buried immediately. So, we all took him down to Panama... ...and put him in the lock and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you see? That\\'s why we told you not to bother about it... ...because we know exactly what\\'s to be done. Wait a minute! Come here, darling. What about the others? All 12 of them didn\\'t walk in here and drop dead. No, dear. Of course not! Well, so... - Mortimer. - What? Do you remember those jars of poison on the shelves... ...in Grandfather\\'s laboratory all these years? You know your Aunt Martha\\'s knack for mixing things. You\\'ve eaten enough of her piccalilli. Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine... ...I take one teaspoonful of arsenic... ...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide. Should have quite a kick. As a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time to say:. \"How delicious! \" He did? Well, wasn\\'t that nice of him? Abby, we mustn\\'t be standing here gossiping all night. We must get that cake frosted. Don\\'t worry about the cake. I couldn\\'t eat a thing. You newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite. That\\'d be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine! Wine! I\\'m beginning to think the cat\\'s in on this. He\\'s wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging locks. Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. I can see the headlines now:. \"Murder Incorporator Rides Again\" right across the front page. Let me see... Teddy! Of course. Everybody knows he\\'s crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up? Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell? No, Winchell\\'s no good. Old Judge Cullman! I wonder if I got his number. What am I doing with tickets? Information. Information? Get me the number of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would you call me back? Wouldn\\'t it be marvelous if he wasn\\'t there? Hey, you! Thought you were tall, dark streak of light. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Didn\\'t you hear me whistle? Whistle? Oh, yes. I heard you whistle. - How do I look? - You look fine. - Run on home. I\\'ll call you up tomorrow. - Tomorrow? You know I always call you up every day or two. You and your gags! Where\\'s your hat? The bags are in the taxi. - Come on! - I\\'m so sorry. Something\\'s happened. What\\'d you do, lose your nerve? Where\\'s that look I was going to see so often? Stop! Don\\'t whistle in my ear, please. What\\'s wrong? Look at your hair. What color is it? Has it turned? Darling, what\\'s the matter? What happened? Those flowers are so beautiful. If I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so nice. You better go home! - But, darling, we were married today. - Go to bed, get some rest! Rest? Who? Judge Cullman? This is Mortimer Brewster. I\\'ll tell you why I called you. It\\'s about Teddy. I\\'ve got to come over and see you right away. It won\\'t wait until tomorrow, Judge. It\\'s very, very important. We\\'ve got to do something immediately. But it\\'s a matter of life and... Elaine! Will you get out of here? What on earth is going on here? I don\\'t know where I stand! - Anywhere, but don\\'t stand there! - But Niagara Falls! - If it does, we\\'ll let it! - Wait a minute! Listen. You can\\'t marry me and then throw me out! I\\'m not throwing you out of the house! Will you get out of here? I\\'m sorry, Judge. A thing happened. Judge, about Teddy, he\\'s... It\\'s his bugle blowing. The police want to throw him into a state institution. How do you like that? - I read an ad here about a room to rent. - Shut up! If you sign the papers and Teddy commits himself, we can get him to Happy Dale. It\\'s a wonderful place. You will? Fine! I\\'ll be over as soon as I\\'ve made another call. Doorbell\\'s ringing, dear. How do you do? Come in. I understand you\\'ve got a room to rent. Do step in. - Are you the lady of the house? - Yes, I\\'m Miss Brewster. Operator? Give me long distance, please. And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster. - My name\\'s Gibbs. - Well, do sit down. I\\'m sorry, we\\'re just setting the table for dinner. Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair. Long distance? I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York. - Is Brooklyn your home? - I live in a hotel. Don\\'t like it. Are your family Brooklyn people? - Haven\\'t got any family. - All alone in the world? - Well, Martha... - No, Happy Dale. Well, you\\'ve come to just the right house. - Do sit down. - Dale. \"D\" like in \"dig,\" when you dig a lock. That\\'s right. \"A\" like in \"arsenic\". Got that? Is there always this much noise? He doesn\\'t live with us. I can see the headlines now. Please. I\\'d like to see the room. I don\\'t think I\\'ll like it. The room\\'s upstairs. Won\\'t you try a glass of our wine before we start up? Never touch it. Well, we make this ourselves. It\\'s elderberry wine. Elderberry? I haven\\'t tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy. - Thank you. - Operator! I don\\'t want the Happy Dale Laundry! I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium! Sanitarium! Sanitarium! Yes, like a broken record! - Have your own elderberry bushes? - No, but the cemetery\\'s full of them. Well, skoal. Hello, operator! What\\'s taking so long? It\\'s only across the river! I could swim it faster! Yes! Hello! Hell... What... What, they\\'re busy? Busy? They\\'re busy and you\\'re dizzy! No, I\\'m not drunk, madam, but you\\'ve given me an idea! Darling, I\\'m nervous. Don\\'t do that. Not that. Get out of here! Do you want to be poisoned, murdered, killed? They\\'re nuts! You\\'re telling me! Look, you can\\'t do things like that! Now I don\\'t know how I can explain this to you... ...but it\\'s not only against the law, it\\'s wrong. Oh, piffle! It\\'s not a nice thing to do. People wouldn\\'t understand. He wouldn\\'t understand. What I mean is... This is developing into a very bad habit! Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium? That\\'s amazing, operator. Happy Dale? Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please. Mr. Witherspoon speaking. How do you do, Mr. Brewster? How are you? Mr. Witherspoon, do you... I\\'m fine, thanks. How are you? Do you remember our conversation about committing my brother to Happy Dale? You do? Well, we want to commit him there immediately. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. That\\'s too bad. Well, I\\'d hoped we wouldn\\'t have him for some time yet. We have several Theodore Roosevelts at the moment... ...and it would lead to trouble. Well, now, if he thought that... Mr. Brewster, we\\'re a bit short of Napoleons at present. Bonaparte. And if... Oh, I see. Of course. Well, if your mind is made up. Yes. Have you had the papers drawn up? No, but I\\'ll do it now and call you as soon as I have them. Thank you, Mr... What? All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon. Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear. Now listen, I\\'m going to Judge Cullman\\'s, but I want you to promise me something. Well, we\\'d have to know what it was first. I love you both very much. You know I\\'d do anything for you, don\\'t you? Yes, dear. I want you to do one thing for me, like good girls. What do you want us to do? Don\\'t do anything. I mean, don\\'t do anything! Don\\'t let anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit where he is. Get off that thing. I can\\'t talk to you... I can\\'t concentrate. I wouldn\\'t want anything in the world to happen to you. What on earth could happen to us? Well, darling... Anyway, you\\'ll do that little thing for me, won\\'t you? Where\\'s my hat? There it is. - But, Mortimer. - What? We were planning to hold services before dinner. - Couldn\\'t that wait until I get back? - You could join us in the hymns! Yes, darling, I\\'ll sing with you, I\\'ll dance with you, anything. Remember, don\\'t let anybody in the house until I get back. You promise? Good. What? Stop that. What is it? Mr. Hoskins\\' hat! - Do you still want me to wait? - Yes! Call me a cab! - Hey, cab! Here you are. - Don\\'t open it. I\\'ll sit with you! Yeah, that\\'s right. I can go faster that way. Sure. Wait a minute! What am I doing? Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins\\' hat all mussed up. Shame! Such a nice hat. You know, Mortimer didn\\'t seem to be quite himself today. Oh, well. What were you saying about Mortimer? I think I understand why he seemed so upset. Why? He\\'s just been married. I believe that always makes a man a little nervous. Yes. The poor dears. I\\'m so happy for Elaine. Abby! If Mortimer\\'s coming back for the services, we\\'ll need another hymnal. There\\'s one up in my room. I\\'ll go, dear. We promised Mortimer we wouldn\\'t let anyone come in. It\\'s two men, and I\\'ve never seen them before. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Let me look. - You look. - Do you recognize them? - No, they\\'re strangers to me. We\\'ll just have to pretend we\\'re not at home. Come in, doctor. This is the home of my youth. As a boy, I couldn\\'t wait to escape from this house. Now I\\'m glad to escape back into it. Yes, Johnny, it\\'s a good hideout. The family must still live here. I hope there\\'s a fatted calf awaiting the return of the prodigal. A fatted calf? Johnny, I\\'m so hungry. Look, Johnny. Drink. As if we were expected. A good omen. Who are you? What are you doing here? Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha. It\\'s Jonathan. You get out of here! I\\'m Jonathan, you know. Your nephew, Jonathan. No, you\\'re not. You\\'re nothing like Jonathan, so don\\'t pretend you are. You just get out of here. I see you\\'re still wearing the lovely garnet ring... ...that Grandma Brewster bought in England. And you, Aunt Martha, still the high collar... ...to hide the scar where Grandfather\\'s acid burned you. Why, his voice is like Jonathan\\'s. Have you been in an accident? My face. Dr. Einstein is responsible for that. He\\'s a plastic surgeon. But I\\'ve seen that face before. Do you remember when we took the little Schultz boy to the movies... ...and I was so frightened? It was that face. Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don\\'t worry. The last five years, I give him three different faces. I give him another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture, too... ...just before I operated. I was intoxicated. You see, doctor, what you\\'ve done to me? - Even my own family think I\\'m... - Johnny, Johnny! You are home in this lovely house. You know... ...how many times he tells me... ...about Brooklyn, about this house and about his aunts... ...he loves so much? They know you. Please tell him so. Jonathan... ...it\\'s been a long time. Bless you. It\\'s good to be home again. We mustn\\'t let what\\'s on the stove boil over. If you\\'ll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you\\'re in a hurry to go somewhere. Where do we go from here? You know, we got to think fast. The police got pictures of that face. I got to operate on you right away. We got to find someplace. We got to find someplace for Mr. Spenalzo, too. Don\\'t waste any worry on that rat. But we got a hot stiff on our hands. Forget Mr. Spenalzo. But, Johnny, we can\\'t leave a dead body in the rumble seat. You shouldn\\'t have killed him. Just because he knows something about us, what happens? We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down. Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That\\'s your work, doctor. You did that to me. Please, Johnny, take it easy. We\\'ll find some place and I\\'ll fix you up right away. Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first. This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity. Yes. I know exactly what I\\'m going to do. You see, I\\'m going to take this piece here and lift it up... Be careful about the stitches this time. You leave that up to me. I\\'ll give you nice ears and... - You were careless last time. - And new stitches. And on the eyes I\\'ll do a Schmidt. That\\'s my specialty. - I take it together like this... - Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone. Poor Teddy. I imagine it\\'s for the best. \"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do... \" Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there. Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic state... Yes, we\\'d all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign here as next of kin, don\\'t I? Only last week I created a mild sensation... ...at the Bar Association, when I said... Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you. Tell Martha and Abby I\\'ll be over this week. I\\'ve been feeling rather lonely. No! Never tell them you\\'ve been lonely. Never! - Why, I don\\'t... - Judge! Tell me, are you a drinking man? Why, no. I never indulge. Good! Then you\\'ll live longer. Of course a little wine now... No! For heaven\\'s sake, no wine! I may be committing the wrong Brewster. Well, I\\'m sure you both want to get to wherever you\\'re going. My dear, sweet aunties, I\\'m so full of your delicious dinner... - ...I\\'m unable to move a muscle. - Yes, it\\'s nice here. I found it! Gentlemen, be seated. Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography. Here\\'s the picture I was telling you about. Here we both are. President Roosevelt and General Goethals at Culebra Cut. That\\'s me, General, and that\\'s you. My, how I\\'ve changed! That picture hasn\\'t been taken yet. We haven\\'t started work on Culebra Cut. We\\'re still digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama and inspect the new lock. No, Teddy. Not to Panama. Maybe some other time, Mr. President. Panama is a long ways off. - Nonsense! It\\'s just down in the cellar. - The cellar? We let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar. - General Goethals? - Yes, sir. As President of the US, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy... ...and the man who gave you this job... ...I demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new lock. I think it\\'s time for you to go to bed. I beg your pardon. Who are you? I\\'m Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed. No, you\\'re not Wilson. But your face is familiar. You\\'re not anyone I know now. Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa. You look like someone I might meet in the jungle. I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and his friend want to get back to their hotel. General Goethals, inspect the canal. All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama. Bully, bully! Follow me, General. It\\'s down south, you know. Well, bon voyage! I must correct your misapprehension. You talked of our hotel. We have no hotel. We came here directly. This is not your home, and I\\'m afraid you can\\'t stay here. Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep. You remember that, as a boy, I could be disagreeable. It would not be pleasant for any of us if... I don\\'t have to go into details, do I? Perhaps we\\'d better let them stay here tonight. Come here. Quick. I forgot to tell you... ...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather\\'s laboratory into an operating room. We expect to be very busy. - Down here, what do you think I find? - What? The Panama Canal. And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo. See the hole he\\'s digging. Four feet wide, six feet long. He just fits! You\\'d think he knew we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along. That\\'s hospitality. Rather a good joke on my aunts. They\\'re living in a house with a body buried in the cellar. How do we get him in here? Yes, we can\\'t just walk Mr. Spenalzo in through the door. We\\'ll get the car and after they\\'re in bed, we\\'ll bring him in through the window. Bed. We\\'re moving the car behind the house. You\\'d better get to bed. The car is all right where it is until morning. I don\\'t want to leave it in the street. That might be against the law. What are we going to do? We\\'re not going to let them spend more than one night in this house. What would the neighbors think? People coming in here with one face and going out with another. What are we going to do about Mr. Hoskins? Mr. Hoskins! It can\\'t be very comfortable for him in there. And he\\'s been so patient, the poor dear. I think Teddy had better take Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away. General Goethals was very pleased. He said the canal was just the right size. Teddy, there\\'s been another yellow-fever victim. Dear me! This will be a shock to the General. No, we must keep it a secret. A state secret? Yes, a state secret. Promise? You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let\\'s see. How are we going to keep it a secret? Teddy, I think you\\'d better get back down into the cellar. And then... ...when I turn out the lights, when everything\\'s dark here... ...you come up and take the poor man down to the canal. Now get along. And we\\'ll come down later and hold services. - Where is the poor devil? - In the windowseat. It seems to be spreading. We\\'ve never had yellow fever there before. I\\'ve never even seen Mr. Hoskins! My goodness! That\\'s right, you were out. You just come right along and see him now. You know, he\\'s really very nice looking, considering that he\\'s a Methodist. We\\'re bringing the luggage through here. Your room is waiting for you. You can go right up. I\\'m afraid we don\\'t keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along to bed. But you must be very tired. Both of you. - And we don\\'t go to bed this early. - It\\'s time I came home to take care of you. Take the bags upstairs. For the instruments, I\\'ll come back later. Good night. Now, we\\'ll all go to bed. I\\'ll wait until you\\'re up and then turn out the lights. Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor. - All right, Aunt Abby. - I\\'ll be right up. Now! Turn out the lights. Aunt Abby. He\\'s all right, Johnny. I\\'ll open the window. You go round and hand him through. But he\\'s too heavy for me. You go outside and push, and I\\'ll stay here and pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. All right. We must be quick. I\\'ll take a look around outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the window. Yeah. It\\'s dark in here. Where am I? Here I am. Who left this open? Okay, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him. Allez, up! Now, wait a minute. You lost a leg somewhere. Help me. He\\'s so heavy. Now I have him. Now I got him. - Be careful. - But his shoe came off. Help me. He\\'s so heavy. Now I\\'ve got him! Johnny, somebody\\'s at the door. Go open, quick. I\\'ll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick! Mortimer! Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha! Who is it? Is that you, Teddy? Who are you? I\\'m Elaine Harper. I live next door. What are you doing here? I came here to see my husband, Mortimer. Why did you say your name was Harper? It is Harper. I mean, it\\'s Brewster. I\\'m not very used to it. I\\'m a brand-new Brewster. Doctor! It\\'s all right. It\\'s okay. Maybe you\\'d better explain what you\\'re doing here. We happen to live here. You don\\'t live here. I\\'m in this house every day, I\\'ve never seen you before. Where are Martha and Abby? What have you done to them? Perhaps we\\'d better introduce ourselves. May I present Dr. Einstein? Dr. Einstein? A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a magician. - I suppose you\\'ll tell me you\\'re Boris... - I am Jonathan Brewster. - You\\'re Jonathan. - You\\'ve heard of me? - Yes, they talk about you. - What do they say about me? Just that there\\'s another brother named Jonathan, that\\'s all. That explains everything. Now that I know who you are... ...I\\'ll just be running along if you\\'ll kindly unlock the door. \"That explains everything\". Just what do you mean by that? Why do you come here at this time of night? I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it was you. You thought you saw someone drive up? Yes. Weren\\'t you just outside? Isn\\'t that your car? - You saw someone at the car? - Yes. - What else did you see? - Just that, that\\'s all! I see. Is that why you came over here? No, I came to see Mortimer. But if he\\'s not home, I\\'ll run... - You\\'ve given two names. - You\\'re hurting me! I think she\\'s dangerous. No visitors. It\\'s going to be a private funeral. - Tell these men who I am! - That\\'s my daughter, Alice. No! Don\\'t be a tomboy. Don\\'t play rough with the gentlemen. Charge! Doctor, the cellar. Let go of me! Let go of me! What\\'s the matter? What\\'s happening down there? What\\'s the matter? What are you doing there? We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room. - We\\'ll call the police. - I\\'ll handle this. Go back to your room. Do you hear me? Don\\'t answer that. Don\\'t answer that! Where\\'s Teddy? Is he upstairs? Never mind that now, darling. What are you doing with your best clothes on? Holy... What\\'s that? What\\'s that thing that looks like a cigar-store dummy? - It\\'s your brother and Dr. Einstein. - Didn\\'t I tell you not to let anybody in? - Who did you say it was? - It\\'s your brother, Jonathan! - I\\'ve come back home, Mortimer. - What? I\\'ve come back home, Mortimer. \"I\\'ve come back home, Mortimer\". Listen, it talks! Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used to do to you... ...when you were tied to the bedpost? The needles under your fingernails. - Mortimer, he... - Wait a minute. Holy mackerel! It is Jonathan! I\\'m glad you remember, Mortimer. Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you? Where\\'d you get that face? Hollywood? Don\\'t you two boys start quarreling the minute you\\'ve seen each other. We invited Jonathan and Dr. Einstein to stay. - What? - Just for tonight. No, I\\'m staying here tonight. - In fact, I\\'m staying here from now on. - What about me? There\\'s no room for anybody else here. Please, just a moment. So take that little squirt and beat it! Where\\'s Teddy? I\\'ve got to see him right away. We don\\'t take up much room. Johnny can sleep on the sofa, and I\\'ll sleep on the windowseat. Nothing to... Windowseat? Certainly not on the windowseat. I\\'m going to sleep on the windowseat. I\\'ll sleep on the windowseat from now on. Now look. Now, be a good fellow. Here\\'s $10. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel. Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around. Mr. Spenalzo. What? What\\'s going to happen to Mr. Spenalzo? We can\\'t leave him here in the windowseat. Doctor, I\\'ve completely lost track of Mr. Spenalzo. Wait! Who\\'s this Mr. Spenalzo? A friend of ours Johnny was looking for. Don\\'t bring anyone else in here. Now, beat it! It\\'s all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I\\'ll tell you about him. I\\'ll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while. How do you like that? The guy stays away for 20 years and picks tonight to come back. Elaine, what are you doing here? - Mortimer! - What\\'s the matter, darling? - I almost got killed. - Killed? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha! No! It was Jonathan! He mistook her for a sneak thief. - Oh, that. - It was worse than that. He\\'s some kind of a maniac. I\\'m afraid of him. Darling, don\\'t worry about it. I\\'m here now. Forget it. We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls... ...your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi\\'s waiting... ...and now you want to sleep on a windowseat! Windowseat. Witherspoon. - You\\'d better run along home. - What? Go on home like a good girl. I got things to do. - But... - Please. Operator? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please. But didn\\'t you hear what I was just saying? Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me! - Please! This is important! - That? Mr. Witherspoon? This is Mortimer Brewster. Yes, Mr. Brewster. Well, I don\\'t understand you. - He was going to kill me! - Wait, I can\\'t hear the man. Well, look. I\\'ve got the papers all drawn up. I know it\\'s late, but come down here and get my brother immediately! Please, darling. By the way, you\\'ve had the papers signed by your brother and the doctor, of course? By the doctor? Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor! Please, be quiet! Can\\'t you see I\\'ve got to get a doctor? What kind of a doctor? A family doctor? You can take your honeymoon, wedding ring, taxi, windowseat... ...put them in a barrel, and push them all over Niagara Falls! Thank you, darling. Thank you. Why don\\'t you come down here anyway? While you\\'re getting here, I\\'ll get Teddy\\'s and the doctor\\'s signatures. I\\'ll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away. What\\'s the matter with her? Let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature... Hoskins! Ye gods! There\\'s another one! Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha! - Come in here! - We\\'re busy. No, you come in here now! Yes, dear, what is it? Where\\'s Elaine? Didn\\'t you promise not to let anyone in? - Jonathan just walked in. - I don\\'t mean Jonathan! I don\\'t mean Dr. Einstein! Who is that in the windowseat? We told you. Mr. Hoskins. It is not Mr. Hoskins! There! Who can that be? - Are you saying you\\'ve never seen him? - I certainly am. This is a fine how-do-you-do! It\\'s getting so anyone thinks he can walk in! Don\\'t you try to get out of this! That\\'s another one of your gentlemen! How can you say such a thing? That man\\'s an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he\\'s mistaken. You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins in the windowseat. Yes, I did. This man couldn\\'t have got the idea from Mr. Hoskins! - By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins? - He must have gone to Panama. - What? You buried him? - Not yet. He\\'s down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven\\'t had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house. Oh, dear. We\\'ve always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger! A total stranger. How can I believe you? There are 12 men down there, you admit you poisoned them! Yes, I did. But you don\\'t think I\\'d stoop to telling a fib! What do you think has happened? \"A fib! \" This may interest you, Mortimer. I\\'ve decided that we\\'re staying. And I\\'ve also decided that you\\'re leaving, and I mean now. Listen, handsome. I\\'m in no mood to debate the question. Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear? I\\'ve led a strange life. Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see what\\'s in that windowseat. No. Don\\'t... Let Aunt Martha see what\\'s in the windowseat. Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology. I\\'ve got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving. And he\\'s taking Dr. Einstein and that cold companion with him. Listen. You\\'re my brother, you\\'re a Brewster. I\\'ll give you a chance to get away and take the evidence with you. You can\\'t ask for more than that. Well? All right, in that case, I\\'ll have to call the police. Don\\'t reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too. Spenalzo? I knew he was a foreigner. Put down that telephone. Officer O\\'Hara! I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness... You got company? Sorry I disturbed you. - No! Come in. - Yes, do come in. Come right in, Officer. This is our nephew, Mortimer. - Pleased to meet you. - Glad to see you. - And this is another nephew, Jonathan. - Pleased to make your acquaintance. Your face is familiar. Haven\\'t I seen a picture of you? I don\\'t think so. - I\\'ll be running along. - Why? Stay until my brother leaves. I got to ring in, Mr... Are you \"the\" Mortimer Brewster, the writer and dramatic critic? Yes, why? What a break for me! I\\'m a playwright. I\\'m working on a play now. You are? Well, well, well! - Maybe I can help you with it. - Would you? What a break! I get wonderful ideas, but I can\\'t spell them. I can spell like the dickens. Constantinople? Let\\'s go into the kitchen. You can tell me all about it. Couldn\\'t you whip up a sandwich? I hope you don\\'t mind eating in the kitchen, Officer O\\'Hara. And where else would you eat? See you in a moment. This is your last chance. I\\'ll keep O\\'Hara busy to give you a chance to get out. All three of you: you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo. If you don\\'t leave here, I\\'ll introduce Officer O\\'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo. My play takes place in... I\\'ll be right with you, O\\'Hara. Right with you. Just give me one moment. Now get going! All three of you. This affair between my brother and myself has got to be settled. But we\\'ve got trouble enough as it is. Come, let\\'s go. We\\'re not going. We\\'re sleeping right here in this house. What? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the windowseat? That\\'s all he\\'s got on us. We\\'ll take Spenalzo and dump him in the bay. After that, we\\'re coming back here. Then if he tries to interfere... No, no, Johnny. No, please. We\\'ve got a wonderful setup here. We can make a fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in our way. I never did like Mortimer. Please, take it easy. Please! Doctor, you know when I make up my mind... When you make up your mind, you lose your head. Look, Brooklyn ain\\'t a good setup for you. Okay, Johnny. Okay! Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move fast. - You don\\'t know what goes on in Brooklyn. - I don\\'t know. - My mother was an actress. - Legitimate? Of course. She was my mother. - Excuse me. - Peaches La Tour was her name. - Come quick! - What\\'s the matter? - You know that hole in the cellar? - Yes. Well, we got an ace in the hole. It\\'s no fly-by-night idea. I worked on it for 12 years. Well, rehash it. I\\'ll be back in a minute. - Swell. - I like the first act. I didn\\'t tell you the first... I thought I told you... Yes, Mortimer. What are you doing still here? I thought I said beat it. We\\'re not going. - You\\'re not going? - No. You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it. - Officer O\\'Hara? - Coming. If you tell O\\'Hara what\\'s in the windowseat... ...I\\'ll tell him what\\'s in the cellar. Cellar? There\\'s an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be very dead. - What were you doing there? - What\\'s he doing there? Now what are you going to tell O\\'Hara? Your aunts want to hear the rest. Shall I bring them in here? You can\\'t do that now. You\\'d better ring in. The heck with ringing in! I want to tell you the plot. You can\\'t tell me in front of those two fellas. Lowbrows, huh? Let\\'s go where we can be alone. I\\'ll meet you there later. How about the backroom at Kelly\\'s? Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at work. You ring in and I\\'ll meet you at Kelly\\'s. Why don\\'t you both go down in the cellar? That\\'s all right with me. There\\'s a much more literary atmosphere in Kelly\\'s, I assure you. This opening will kill you. I\\'m waiting to be born and the doctor... The doctor! Look, you ring in and I\\'ll see you later. You won\\'t stand me up, will you? This is a great play. - I\\'ll see you down there. - Can\\'t wait! Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers? There they are. You\\'re smug, aren\\'t you? You think you\\'ve got it over me. You haven\\'t. You think I\\'m afraid to tell about Spenalzo because of Hoskins. Well, I\\'m not! The moment I get Spenalzo... The moment the doctor signs, I don\\'t care who knows about Hoskins. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo! - Where are you going? - To the doctor\\'s. Where do you... When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me! We\\'ll wait for him. Did he look guilty! Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now. We thought we heard you leave. Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer. And speaking of services... ...will you make us some coffee while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar? No, Jonathan. You\\'ve got to take him with you! There\\'s a friend of Mortimer\\'s downstairs waiting for him. - A friend of Mortimer\\'s? - Take his feet, Doctor. Mr. Spenalzo and he will get along fine together. They\\'re both dead. He must mean Mr. Hoskins. Mr. Hoskins? You know about what\\'s down there? Of course we do. And he\\'s no friend of Mortimer\\'s. - He\\'s one of our gentlemen. - Your gentlemen? Yes. And we won\\'t have any strangers buried in our cellar. - But Mr. Hoskins... - Mr. Hoskins is no stranger. Besides, there\\'s no room for Mr. Spenalzo. The cellar\\'s crowded already. Crowded? With what? There are 12 graves down there now. Twelve graves. That leaves very little room and we\\'re going to need it. You mean, you and Aunt Martha have murdered 12... Murdered? Certainly not. It\\'s one of our charities. Why, what we\\'ve been doing is a mercy. So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo out of here. You\\'ve done all that... ...right here in this house and buried them in the cellar? That\\'s wonderful, Johnny! We\\'ve been chased all over the world... ...and they stay right here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do. What? You got 12, they got 12. I\\'ve got 13. - No, Johnny, 12. Don\\'t brag. - Thirteen. There\\'s Mr. Spenalzo. Then the first one in London. Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne... ...two in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix? - The filling station. - Filling... Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes 13. You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of pneumonia. He wouldn\\'t have died of pneumonia if I hadn\\'t shot him. You cannot count him. You got 12, they got 12. The old ladies is just as good as you are. They are, are they? Well, that\\'s easily taken care of. All I need is one more. That\\'s all. Just one more. And I\\'ve a pretty good idea who it is. I\\'m a lucky man to have caught you at home, Dr. Gilchrist. This is most irregular. I\\'m sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but only you can help me. I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can\\'t commit a man just on that. If you\\'d talk with him... ...I\\'m sure you\\'d be convinced. Here\\'s the house I... - There goes Hoskins. - Who? What? Did I say... - You better wait. - Here? I\\'ll bring Teddy out. I wouldn\\'t want to alarm the old ladies, seeing a doctor. - You wait here. - In the cemetery? It\\'s Halloween. The pixies won\\'t be out till after midnight. Make yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I\\'ll be right back. - Hey, $22.50! - What? $22.50! Oh, yes, looks good on you! Not the suit, the meter! \"Looks good on me\". $22.50. - Did you give him a 21-gun salute? - Yes, with a Maxim silencer. Five more bucks and you\\'ll own it. No, thanks. It wouldn\\'t fit me. - Mr. President, may I present... - Dr. Livingstone! - Livingstone? - That\\'s what he presumes. The doctor would like to have a few words with you. Certainly. Welcome to Washington. Arlington is beautiful at this time of year, is it not? Yes, indeed. Well now, that\\'s that. It gives me a chance to rest. So far, so good. Not so good. Do you or do you not love me? How can you say such a thing? Darling, of course I love you. - Do you? - Yes, darling. Then why have you been treating me the way you have? Darling, I love you so much, I can\\'t go through with our marriage. Have you suddenly gone crazy? I don\\'t think so, but it\\'s only a matter of time. Darling, would you want to have children with three heads? You wouldn\\'t want to set up housekeeping in a padded cell. - What are you talking about? - Well, I don\\'t quite know. I probably should have told you this before, but you see... ...well, insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops. Just because Teddy\\'s strange, that doesn\\'t mean... No, darling. It\\'s way back before Teddy. This goes back to the first Brewster who came over on the Mayflower. You know how in those days the Indians used to scalp the settlers? He used to scalp the Indians. Darling, that\\'s ancient history. Doctor, I\\'ll run for a third term, but I won\\'t be elected. That\\'ll mean the last of the Roosevelts in the White House. - That\\'s what you think. - Of course, if the country insists... Darling, all this doesn\\'t prove a thing. Look at your aunts. They\\'re Brewsters, aren\\'t they? They\\'re the sweetest, sanest people I\\'ve ever known. Well, even they have their peculiarities. What of it? So your family\\'s crazy. So you\\'re crazy. That\\'s the way I love you. I\\'m crazy too, but kiss me. No, no. I... Goodbye, Ambassador. I\\'ve enjoyed this little talk very much. Anytime you\\'re in Washington, drop in to see me at the White House. - Those papers. - Go away. Papers! - I\\'ll commit him to any place. - You will? I\\'ve just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia! You see? Didn\\'t I tell you? Don\\'t worry about that. Just go on signing the papers. Thank you. All right! We\\'ll find out whose house this is! I\\'m warning you, you better stop it. There\\'s no use doing what you\\'re doing. It\\'ll just have to be undone. Aunt Abby, go to bed! It\\'s a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner. Where have you been? Getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in his room? What is the matter with you? Running around getting papers signed at a time like this. Martha and I are going for the police. Police! Wait! - You can\\'t go for the police. - Oh, no? You know what Jonathan\\'s doing? He\\'s putting Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Spenalzo in together. All right, let him. This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake. The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal. Bed feels good already. You know, we didn\\'t get any sleep for 48 hours. You\\'re forgetting, Doctor. If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo aren\\'t out this house before morning... ...we\\'re going for the police. I\\'ll get them out, I promise! - Then you get the wedding silver. - Remember, no police! No police! Look, go to bed, will you? Get out of those clothes! You look like a double blackout. My brother, Mortimer. I just heard him upstairs. No! I am tired. You forget, I got to operate on your face tomorrow. You are going to operate tomorrow, Doctor. But tonight we are taking care of Mortimer. But Johnny, not tonight! I\\'m sleepy. We\\'ll do it tomorrow. Or the next day. Look at me, Doctor. You can see that it\\'s got to be done, can\\'t you? Yeah, I know that look. It\\'s a little late to dissolve our partnership. Okay, Johnny. Okay, we\\'ll do it. But the quick way, huh? The quick twist like in London. No, Doctor. I think this calls for something special. I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method. Not the Melbourne method, please! Two hours! And then when it was all over, what? The fellow in London was just as dead as the fellow in Melbourne. Don\\'t do that, Mr. President. But I cannot sign anything without consulting my Cabinet. This must be secret. A secret proclamation? How unusual. Yes, it\\'s the only way we can outsmart the other fellow. - Who\\'s the other fellow? - That\\'s the secret. Oh, I see! Very clever. A secret proclamation has to be signed in secret. - Of course, Mr. President. - I\\'ll put on my signing clothes. You already have them on, Mr. President. So I have. Wait here. Hey, Mr. Brewster. What is it, mice? - You get out of this house. - Can\\'t you see I\\'m busy? Thank you, Mr. President. What a load off my mind. Boy, could I use a drink! - Get out of here, will you, please? - What? Speak up. I can\\'t hear you. Johnny\\'s in a bad mood. Get out! - Stop underplaying. I can\\'t hear you. - Please listen to me. Get out. Stop all this! What are you doing? Look, Doc... Are you really a doctor? Yes, Heidelberg, 1919. Heidelberg? How\\'d you hook up with Jonathan? I tell you later about that, but you go now. Please listen to me. Stop it, Doctor! You get out of here! Look, when Johnny\\'s in that mood... ...he\\'s a madman. He\\'s a maniac! And then things happen. Horrible things. - Get out of here! - Will you stop it? Stop telling me about Jonathan, I\\'ll take care of him. You take care of yourself. Get going, little fellow. - What\\'s that? Wait. - My schnapps. - I could use that. - That\\'s mine. Please. Only for dramatic critics. You beat it before things start popping around here. But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You\\'ve just been married. You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now. Please. Don\\'t those plays you see all the time teach you anything? Don\\'t get me on the subject of plays! I\\'ve got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon. At least people in plays act like they got sense. Did anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence? - How can somebody be so stupid? - You ought to have my job. When you get out of prison, have yourself wheeled to the Garrick Theater. There\\'s a play that\\'s so bad, it\\'ll still be running when you get out. There\\'s a man... Now listen to this. He knows he\\'s in the house with murderers and should know he\\'s in danger. He\\'s even been warned to get out. And does he go? No, he doesn\\'t. He stays! This fellow doesn\\'t even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard. The murderer even invites him to sit down. - What do you think he does? - I don\\'t know. He sits down! He deliberately pulls up a chair and he sits down in it. Isn\\'t that great? So there he is, all waiting to be trussed up and gagged. What do you think they tied him up with? The curtain cord. Curtain cord? But didn\\'t he see him get it? No. The silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer. All he has to do is look around, but does he? No! See, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even in a movie... ...a fellow never sees or hears anything. That\\'s right. But what does he do? The big chump sits there. This fellow\\'s supposed to be bright. Now get a load of this. Look at the attitude. Large as life! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged. The big dope! You were right about that fellow. He wasn\\'t very bright. Yes, Mortimer. I\\'ve been away for 20 years. But never, my dear brother, were you out of my mind. In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you. The more you struggle the more you strangle yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing. Now, Doctor... ...we go to work. Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please. - This must be an artistic achievement. - Please. After all, we\\'re performing before a very distinguished critic. Please! All right. Let\\'s get it over with. But I cannot see this without the drink. Pull yourself together. But I can\\'t pull myself together without a drink. You remember when we came in, there was some wine. And then they took it. Where did they put it? I found some wine. Here, I\\'ll split it with you. We both have a drink before we operate. I am so happy that we don\\'t have to operate without a drink. One moment, please. Where are your manners? Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. To my dear, dead brother. That idiot! - He goes next. That\\'s all. He goes next! - Not Teddy! Please! - We\\'ll get to him later. - You won\\'t at all! We have to work fast. The quick way. The quick way, yes! If it has to be, then the quick way. I\\'ll help you. The colonel has to quit blowing that horn. It\\'s all right. We\\'re taking the bugle away from him. I\\'d better talk to him myself. Where\\'s the lights? You stood me up! I\\'ve been waiting for you for over an hour at Kelly\\'s. - What happened to him? - Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw and that\\'s what happened to a man in the play. I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw? How do you like that? You can\\'t trust nobody. They practically stole that from my play. In the second act, just... Maybe I\\'d better start at the beginning. Yeah, sure. You\\'ve got to hear the plot! My mother\\'s making up. Like a flash, out of a clear sky... ...the door opens and a man with a mustache comes in. He says, \"Miss Peaches La Tour, will you marry me?\" That\\'s the first scene. My mother doesn\\'t say they\\'re married. That\\'s the surprise! What a kick! Twenty-five years pass. Well, in the meantime, there\\'s me. Growing into a magnificent specimen. So what do I do? I join the police force and become one of New York\\'s finest. I\\'m cleaning out a crooked laundry, see? Little do I know it... ...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me. I\\'m in great danger. It\\'s getting you, ain\\'t it? I can see it in your eyes. You ain\\'t heard nothing yet. All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect! Firemen rush in and who\\'s leading them? Mayor Fiorello La Guardia! What\\'s the matter with him? - Probably your play put him to sleep. - What? - I personally like it very much. - It\\'s probably over his head. - Where have I seen that face before? - No, please. The scene changes. It\\'s an evolving stage. I\\'m walking along my beat, casual-like... ...when a guy that I\\'m following, it turns out he\\'s following me! Don\\'t let nobody in. I figures I\\'ll outsmart him. - There\\'s a vacant house on the corner. - Johnny, the cops! I sees the door handle turn, so I pulls out my gun... ...braces myself against the wall and I says: \"Come in! \" Hello, boys. - What the Sam Hill\\'s going on? - Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster. - He\\'s going to help me write my play. - Do you have to tie him up? Report in. Why didn\\'t you ring in? The whole force is out looking for you. Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you here? No, we came to warn the old ladies. - The colonel blew that bugle again. - I heard him. The neighbors are phoning in. The Lieutenant\\'s on the warpath. He says we\\'ve got to put him away someplace. Now, who the heck is this? Mr. Brewster\\'s brother. My play put him to sleep. That\\'s the one that ran away. So he came back. Brophy. Get me Mac. Have you got yourself in a mess! You\\'re two hours overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found you. It wasn\\'t that bad, was it? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt. We found him. At the Brewster house. Shall we bring him in? All right, we\\'ll hold him right here. The Lieutenant is on his way over. So I\\'ve been turned in? All right, you\\'ve got me. I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the reward. Yes, reward! Now I\\'ll do some turning in! Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster. You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don\\'t you? Well, there\\'s 13 bodies buried in the cellar! Yes, 13. Be careful what you say. Your aunts are friends of ours. - I\\'ll show them to you. - Don\\'t make trouble for them! Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me. - Come down to the cellar. - Wait a minute. Thirteen bodies. I\\'ll show you where they\\'re buried. - Go to the cellar with him. - Yes, come to the cellar. Well, look, do I have to? Maybe I don\\'t want to go down to the cellar. Go on down the cellar with him! Now, please. I\\'ll tell you the rest of my play later. - Go on down the cellar with him. - Do I have to? Look at that puss. He looks like Boris Karloff. Don\\'t! Sarge! Look out, Pat! - Look out! - He\\'s got a gun. I got him, Pat. Look out! Fight. Go on and fight. That\\'s enough, that\\'s enough. Everybody off. Pat, look out! Amazing. Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Don\\'t bother me now. You could use this in the third act. I got something better. Let me tell you... I\\'ll see you later. The papers are all signed. What do I care? Go ahead, fight. I\\'d better call and see if Witherspoon has left. Telephone. I\\'ll get every one of you! I hate cops. I\\'ll brain the first one that comes near me! A little higher, brother. Thank you very much. That\\'s fine. Don\\'t do that, please. Get him, Pat. That won\\'t have any effect. I\\'ve tried it before... It did. Isn\\'t that amazing? Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that. - Witherspoon. - Come in. What has occurred? Never mind! Didn\\'t I tell you I\\'d handle this? Well, Lieutenant! - We were just acting in self-defense. - What happened? He put up a fight? This isn\\'t the one who blows the bugle. - This is his brother who tried to kill O\\'Hara. - All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff. Boris... Turn him over. Kind of think he\\'s wanted somewhere. You \"kind of think he\\'s wanted somewhere\"? If you guys can\\'t look at the circulars we put up... ...you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly, he\\'s wanted. In Indiana! He escaped from the prison for criminally insane. He\\'s a lifer. That\\'s my brother. That\\'s the way they described him. \"He looked like Karloff\". Why\\'d you knock him out? He tried to get us to go to the cellar. He says 13 bodies are there. Thirteen bodies in the cellar... ...and that don\\'t tip you off the guy\\'s from a nuthouse? Thanks, pal. About my not ringing in, I want to... Where have you been all night? Don\\'t tell me. I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster. You\\'re going to have a long time on that play. You\\'re suspended. Now go on. Report in. Bring him to and find out where his accomplice is. The guy who helped him escape. He\\'s wanted, too. Here. I\\'ve been after these guys for 48 hours. Nothing to eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn\\'s in the shape it\\'s in. With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story like that! Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar. But there are 13 bodies in the cellar! - Who are you? - I\\'m President Roosevelt. - What the blazes is this? - He\\'s the one that blows the bugle. Howdy, Colonel. Colonel, you\\'ve blown your last bugle. Get this guy out of here. Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim? All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims. No, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the White House. Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him. - Questioning of spies is my department. - Hey, you, keep out of that. You\\'re forgetting that as President I am also head of the Secret Service. Who are you? What\\'s your name? Usually, I\\'m Mortimer Brewster. But I\\'m not myself today. You\\'re his brother. Look, no argument. He\\'s got to be put away. No arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute, take it easy. Read this. Teddy\\'s going to go to Happy Dale tonight. - I\\'m waiting for Mr. Witherspoon. - As long as he\\'s going someplace. He\\'s scaring the neighbors with that bugle. And that cockeyed story about 13 bodies being... I\\'ve been without sleep for 48 hours. I\\'m liable to think anything. I know just how you feel. There\\'s people dumb enough to believe that. Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove... - What\\'s this? - What\\'s the matter? - These papers aren\\'t any good. - Why not? He signed it Theodore Roosevelt! - Is your taxi engaged? - Losing dough every minute. Any offers? I\\'m Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster. I would like you to drive us back to the sanitarium. I knew this would end up in a nuthouse! We like to think of it as a rest home. Mr. Brewster? Mr. Witherspoon is here. Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the safety of the nation! - No, it\\'s chicanery. - What is this? Come on! - He\\'s come to. He\\'s ready to talk. - Hold him till I get there. Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt. - Code for Roosevelt? - Take the name Brewster. Take away the \"B\" and what have you got? - Rooster. - And what does a rooster do? - Crows. - It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa? - On the veldt! - There you are! \"Crowsveldt\". Ingenious! My compliments to the boys in the code department. That\\'s all right! Do that again for me. Never mind! Give me that pen. This is fun. Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon. I\\'m so glad to see you. You will take good care of Teddy? - Best of care of him. - That\\'s fine. And no wagon when he leaves. Why? To take him away? Never, never. Taxicabs. We always... I have one waiting now. It means a great deal to me. You will personally see that Teddy\\'s happy at Happy Dale? - He\\'ll be very happy at Happy Dale. - That\\'s good. You know, I sometimes envy some of our patients, secretly. You do? It must be a nice place. I\\'ve never been there. You never can tell. This is a particularly happy moment for me tonight. - I\\'ve never met a dramatic critic before. - The woods are full of them. I have here something that will explain what we\\'re trying to do. - A pamphlet about Happy Dale? - No, it\\'s a play. Something I\\'ve been working on. It\\'s a dramatization of many incidents that have happened at Happy Dale. Captain! Captain! I want you to read this carefully. I want you to be just as harsh as you like. I shan\\'t mind, you know... Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon. He\\'ll be very happy at Happy Dale. - Come, my boy. - What is this? No, you got it wrong. This is Captain Rooney. The police? I\\'m sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take him away. I\\'ll be in my office vetoing some bills. Mr. President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over. - Is this March 4? - Practically. Let\\'s see... Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa! Well, I must get started immediately. Is he trying to move into the White House before I\\'ve moved out? Who, Mr. President? Taft! No, this isn\\'t Mr. Taft. It\\'s Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa. Bully! Bully! Wait right here. I\\'ll bring down my equipment. Happy man. Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha. I\\'m on my way to Africa. Isn\\'t it wonderful? Charge! It\\'s all right, I\\'ve got it. Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases. You\\'ve come to meet Teddy, haven\\'t you? No, he\\'s come to take him. Teddy\\'s been blowing his bugle again. No, he can\\'t go now! We won\\'t permit it. We promise to take his bugle away from him. - We won\\'t be separated from Teddy. - I\\'m sorry. How can you allow this? You promised. Brewster\\'s got nothing to do with this. The law is the law! Teddy\\'s committed himself and he\\'s got to go. - If he\\'s going, we\\'re going, too! - Yes, you\\'ll have to take us with him. Why not? Why not, indeed? It\\'s sweet of them, but impossible. We never take sane people at Happy Dale. These little sane people will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that. Just put them in and they\\'ll get all mixed up. Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy. Now, let\\'s be sensible, ladies. Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some serious work. There are still murders to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain\\'t only his bugle blowing. Things are going to get worse. We\\'re liable to have to dig up your cellar. Our cellar? Teddy\\'s been telling around there\\'s 13 bodies buried in the cellar. There are 13 bodies in our cellar. What? Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer. Charge! Isn\\'t that amazing? You behave yourself. You know very well there are 13 bodies down in our cellar. Certainly there\\'s 13 bodies in the cellar. And there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain! - What is this? - You mustn\\'t mind Mortimer. - How about it? - I\\'ll be right there. He\\'s been a little strange all day. Right now I wouldn\\'t know what is and what ain\\'t strange anymore. - I\\'ll look in that cellar. - I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do. I\\'ll bring my bodies from the attic and you get yours from the cellar... ...and we\\'ll get them all together, and we\\'ll send them to Happy Dale. No, you wouldn\\'t have to dig. The graves are all marked. - We put flowers on them every Sunday. - Flowers? Sure, I put neon lights on mine. Humor them, humor them. Smile. There\\'s one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo... Hasn\\'t got it yet. ...who doesn\\'t belong here and has to leave. - But the other 12 are our gentlemen. - Your gentlemen? You\\'d like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen. - You mustn\\'t mind him at all. - He got married today. \"There is a Happy Dale far, far away \"There is a Happy\" He got it. It\\'s amazing. Don\\'t you think you can find room for the ladies? Just the ladies? Just the ladies! - How about it? - They\\'d have to be committed. Teddy committed himself. Couldn\\'t they? - All they have to do is sign the papers. - Certainly. If we can go with Teddy, we\\'ll sign the papers. Where are they? I have them, ladies, right here. Sign them up, will you? I want this all cleaned up. I\\'m going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand him. Thirteen bodies in the cellar. Ladies, if you\\'ll sign right here. - Here? - Yes, please. It\\'s on the right-hand side there. I\\'m really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here has changed so. Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing. Oh, dear, I\\'m so sorry. We\\'ve overlooked something. It\\'s absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a physician. A doctor. Dr. Einstein! Come here and sign some papers, please. - Good night. - Come here, Dr. Einstein. - A doctor? - Yes. Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier. Come along, Doctor. Now, here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor. - Were you leaving, Doctor? - Yes, please. Aren\\'t you going to wait for Jonathan? I don\\'t think we go to the same place. Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that\\'s wanted in Indiana. His accomplice\\'s description is on the circular, on the desk. Read it to me, will you? About 40. Five-foot-three. One hundred and forty pounds. Pop eyes. Talks with a German accent. Poses as a doctor. Okay, Mac. Thanks. It\\'s all right. The doctor has completed the signatures. That\\'s great! Thanks, Doc. You\\'ve done Brooklyn a great service. But Dr. Einstein! - Now, Mr. Witherspoon... - You\\'re Witherspoon, I\\'m Brewster. It\\'s contagious, yes. It\\'s your turn. - Don\\'t play games... - You sign. You sign as next of kin. Why didn\\'t you say so? I\\'m all confused. Don\\'t mind me. Mr. Witherport. - Spoon. - Here. Come up and pack my duffel. Duffel? Pack his duffel. He\\'s President, you know? And bring along my bugle. President. Don\\'t charge! We\\'re really very worried about something. Now, darling, don\\'t be worried. - Me too, Mortimer. - Well, of course, darling. You\\'ll both be very happy at Happy Dale. We\\'re very happy about the whole thing, but that\\'s just it. We don\\'t want anything to go wrong. Will they investigate those signatures? - They won\\'t look up Dr. Einstein... - But it\\'s not his signature, dear. - It\\'s yours. - Mine? You see, you signed as next of kin. - What\\'s wrong about that, darling? - Martha, you tell him. Well, dear. - What, dear? - You\\'re not really a Brewster. - What? - Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and such a good cook... ...we didn\\'t want to lose her. So brother married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a chef on a tramp steamer. You mean I\\'m not really a Brewster? - Darling! - Don\\'t feel so badly about it. I\\'m sure it won\\'t make any difference to Elaine. Where are you? Can you hear me? I\\'m not really a Brewster! I\\'m the son of a sea cook! It\\'s true! I saw them. It\\'s true. It\\'s true! There are 13 bodies down there! But I saw them... What\\'s all this screaming about? - But I saw them... - It\\'s way past her bedtime. Quiet! - But, Mortimer... - Goodbye! - \\'Bye. - Goodbye, darling! - What is all this? - They\\'re going on their honeymoon. They\\'re off to a flying start. I really did see... You\\'ll own two cabs! I mean the meter! Oh, Mortimer. We\\'re going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear. Yes, love. But, Mr. Brewster! I\\'m not a Brewster. I\\'m a son of a sea cook. Charge! I\\'m not a cabdriver. I\\'m a coffeepot!

My recommendation is still the same. Spread the good word in as many small-time segments as we can. Let the opposition have their high ratings while we cry all the way to the bank. Why don\\'t we colonize at the Colony next week? Let me hear from you, Sam. Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera. You better walk me to the Plaza. I didn\\'t put a coat on. - Use your blood sugar, child.

She\\'ll think she\\'s eating money. Just say to her: \"Darling, I count the days, the hours... \" - You sent that one last time. - I did? Well, put: \"Something for your sweet tooth, baby, and all your other sweet parts. \" - I know. - Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill? - For two blocks? - You\\'re late and I\\'m tired.

Oh, wait, Maggie. You can\\'t call her. She\\'s at Mrs... - Good evening. Good evening. I\\'m looking for Mr. Weltner and two other gentlemen. Yes, sir. Right this way. Herman. - Roger. - I\\'m a little late. - Roger Thornhill. - Fanning Nelson. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Larry Wade. - We got a little head start here. - Oh, that won\\'t last long. I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be slow on starting but there\\'s nobody faster. - What\\'s the matter? You\\'ve got the fidgets. - I just did something stupid. I told my secretary to call Mother. I realized she won\\'t be able to reach her. Why not? - She\\'s playing bridge at one of her cronies\\'. - Your secretary? - No. My mother. One of those new apartments. Wet paint and no telephone yet. George Kaplan. - Perhaps if I send her a telegram. - Mr. George Kaplan? Boy. - Kaplan. - I\\'ve got to get off a wire immediately. Could you send it for me if I write it out for you? Oh, I\\'m not permitted to do that, sir, but if you\\'ll follow me. - Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen? - Go right ahead. - Right through there, sir. - Yeah, thanks. Thank you, sir. Wait, what\\'s that supposed to be? The car\\'s waiting outside. You will walk between us saying nothing. - What are you talking about? - Let\\'s go. Let\\'s go where? Who...? Who are you? Mere errand boys carrying concealed weapons. His is pointed at your heart. So, please, no errors of judgment, I beg of you. What is this, a joke or something? - Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car. - Come. But this is ridiculous. Don\\'t tell me where we\\'re going, surprise me. You know, I left some friends back there in the Oak Bar. They\\'re going to think I\\'m awfully rude. I mean, uh, couldn\\'t we stop off at a drugstore for a moment... ...so that I could explain I\\'m being, uh, kidnapped? Well, that is what\\'s happening, isn\\'t it? Locked. Who\\'s Townsend? Really? Interesting. - Where is he? - Upstairs, dressing. - Tell him I\\'m here. - The dinner guests are expected. Never mind that. Say to him: \"Kaplan. \" By the way, what are we having for dessert? - Is anyone in the library? - No. This way. You will wait here. Well, don\\'t hurry. I\\'ll catch up on my reading. Good evening. Not what I expected. A little taller. A little more polished than the others. Oh, I\\'m so glad you\\'re pleased, Mr. Townsend. But I\\'m afraid just as obvious. What the devil is all this about? Why was I brought here? Games? Must we? Not that I mind a case of abduction... ...but I have tickets for the theater this evening. To a show I was looking forward to. And I get unreasonable about things like that. With such expert play-acting, you make this very room a theater. Oh, Leonard, have you met our distinguished guest? He\\'s a well-tailored one, isn\\'t he? My secretary is a great admirer of your methods, Mr. Kaplan. - Elusiveness, however misguided... - Wait a minute. Wait, wait. - Did you call me \"Kaplan\"? - I know you\\'re a man of many names... ...but I\\'m perfectly willing to accept your current choice. Current choice? My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill. It\\'s never been anything else. Of course. Your friends picked up the wrong package when they bundled me out here in the car. Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan. I told you, I\\'m not Kaplan, whoever he is. I\\'m... - Excuse me. Yes? The guests are here, dear. Look after them. I\\'ll be with you in a few minutes. Now, shall we get down to business? I\\'m all for that. Simply, I\\'d like you to tell me how much you know of our arrangements... ...and how you\\'ve come by this information. - I don\\'t expect to get this for nothing. - Of course not. Don\\'t misunderstand, I don\\'t expect you to fall in with this suggestion... ...but the least I can do is afford you the opportunity of surviving the evening. What the devil is that supposed to mean? Why don\\'t you surprise me, Mr. Kaplan, and say yes? I\\'ve already told you... - We know where you\\'re headed for. I know where I\\'m headed. I\\'m headed for the Winter Garden Theater in New York, and I think I\\'d better get going. Townsend, you\\'re making a serious mistake. This is not going to lead to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan. I\\'m not Kaplan. - I do wish you\\'d reconsider. We also know your contact in Pittsburgh since Jason committed suicide. What contact? I\\'ve never even been in Pittsburgh. On June the 16th, you checked into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh... ...as Mr. George Kaplan of Berkeley, California. A week later, you registered at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel... ...as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh. On August 11th, you stayed at the Statler in Boston. August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston registered at the Whittier in Detroit. At present, you are registered in room 796... ...at the Plaza Hotel in New York as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit. - Really? - In two days... ...you are due at the Ambassador East in Chicago. And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel in Rapid City, South Dakota. - Not me. - There\\'s very little sense... ...in maintaining that you\\'re deceiving us any more than we\\'re deceiving you. I don\\'t suppose it would do any good to show you ID cards... ...a driver\\'s license, things like that? - They provide you with such good ones. It\\'s getting late. I have guests. Do you intend to cooperate with us? I\\'d like a simple yes or no. A simple no. For the simple reason I simply don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard. A pleasant journey, sir. - Scotch? Rye? Bourbon? Vodka? - Nothing. I\\'ll take a quick ride back to town. Oh, that has been arranged. But first, a libation. Bourbon. You drink it. I\\'ve had enough stimulation for one day. It\\'ll be easier if you take this yourself. Otherwise, it\\'ll be necessary for us to insist. Cheers. Don\\'t worry about me, fellas. I\\'ll take the bus. Thanks for the lift, fellas. I want this man examined for driving while intoxicated. - Really? - Yeah. You see, they tried to kill me. He won\\'t listen to me. In a big house, they tried to kill me. - All right, let\\'s just go inside. - I don\\'t wanna go inside. - Somebody call the police. - Come on. Come on now. Okay. Sit down. I don\\'t wanna sit. Perfectly all right. See? We\\'ll get them. We\\'ll throw the book at them. Assault and kidnapping. Assault with a gun, and a bourbon, and a sports car. We\\'ll get them. You\\'ll be all right after a good night\\'s sleep. We got a nice cell all made up. - I don\\'t want a cell. I want a policeman. - The car was just reported stolen. - Uh-huh. - A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road. - I got to call someone. Where\\'s the phone? - You\\'re allowed one call. - Over here. - Oh, thanks. You better make it your lawyer. Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8. What am I, a telephone operator? Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8. Just a minute, please. Here. Thank you. Hello, Mother? Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill. Yeah. Wait a minute, I\\'ll find out. - Where am I? - Glen Cove Police Station. Glen Cove Police Station. No. No, Mother, I have not been drinking. No. No, these two men, they poured a whole bottle of bourbon into me. No, they didn\\'t give me a chaser. No. Come on, let\\'s go. - Wait, I\\'m not finished yet. - Yes, you are. Come on. Mother, I gotta go now. Get my lawyer right away, and come out and bail me out. Tomorrow morning, tell her. Tomorrow morning, he says. I don\\'t know. I\\'ll ask him. She wants to know who says. Sergeant Emile Klinger. Sergeant Emile... Emile? Sergeant Emile Klinger. No, I didn\\'t believe it either. Uh, I\\'m all right, Mother. Good night. Good night, dear. That was Mother. Let\\'s go. Here\\'s your man, doctor. - What\\'s your name? - Roger Thornhill. Stick out your tongue and say \"ah. \" You better move back. Ah... Have you been drinking? Doctor, I am gassed. What were you drinking? Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas, they... - How much would you say you drank? - What did you say? - How much would you say that you drank? - About this much. Mr. Thornhill, it is my opinion that you are definitely intoxicated. No question about it. I am now gonna ask your permission to draw blood. How disgusting. \"You may refuse to permit a blood test to be made... ...but if you do, your license will be revoked. You have the right to notify a physician of... \" It was at this point that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping... ...from his would-be assassins, and when they gave chase... ...he naturally had to drive as best he could under the, uh, circumstances. Counselor, how long have you known your client? Seven years, Your Honor. Do you know him to be a reasonable man? Absolutely. - Ha. - Mother. And do you believe... ...there is some credence to this story? - Credence? - Well, yes, Your Honor. I mean, if my client says this is what happened... ...I\\'m certain it must\\'ve happened. - You\\'re damn right. Sergeant, I want this turned over to the county detectives for investigation. Call them up and have them come here immediately. - Right, Your Honor. Counselor... ...I\\'m going to set this over for final disposition... ...tomorrow night at 7:30. At which time I expect you and the defendant to be here, ready to go to trial. In the meantime, the county detectives will determine if his story has any basis in fact. \"Basis in fact\"? If I were brought in dead, you still wouldn\\'t believe... Roger, wait a minute. I mean, after all, Your Honor, would I make up such a story? That is precisely what we\\'re intending to find out, Mr. Thornhill. - Yes? Remember me? - Yes, sir. Good. - Is Mr. Townsend at home? - No, I\\'m sorry he\\'s left for the day, sir. Mrs. Townsend? - Who shall I say is calling? - County detectives. Come in, please. This way, please. This is the room. - I\\'ll call madam. You do that. And here\\'s the sofa where they held me down. They spilled bourbon all over it. I\\'ll show you the stains. Well, they must\\'ve cleaned them off. This is the cabinet where they keep the liquor. Scotch, gin, vodka... And bourbon. I remember when it used to come in bottles. Roger, dear, we were so worried about you. Did you get home all right? Of course you did. Let me look at you. Oh, a little pink-eyed, but aren\\'t we all? It was a dull party. You didn\\'t miss a thing. I want you all to know, I never saw this woman before last night. I\\'m Captain Junket of the Nassau County Detectives. - This is Lieutenant Harding. - How do you do? You haven\\'t gotten into trouble, Roger? - Stop calling me Roger. - Has he gotten into trouble? Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night driving under the influence of alcohol... ...and incidentally, in a stolen car. - Stolen car? Belonging to Mrs. Babson of Twining Road. Roger, you said you were going to call a cab. - You didn\\'t borrow Laura\\'s Mercedes? - No, I didn\\'t borrow Laura\\'s Mercedes. Mr. Thornhill told us that he was brought to this house against his will last night... ...and, uh, forcibly intoxicated by some friends of your husband... ...and set out on the road. - Do you know anything about this? - Well, now, captain... ...Roger was a bit tipsy when he arrived here by cab for dinner. She\\'s lying. And I\\'m afraid he became even worse... ...as the evening wore on. Finally, he told us he had to go home to sleep it off. Oh, I knew I should\\'ve served dinner earlier. What a performance. Mrs. Townsend, does the name George Kaplan mean anything to you? George Kaplan? - No. - I didn\\'t think so. Where\\'s her husband? He\\'s the one you should be questioning. - Is there any place he can be reached? - Why, yes. The United Nations. United Nat...? He\\'s addressing the General Assembly this afternoon. All right. So he\\'s addressing the General Assembly. - Sorry we had to bother you. - No bother at all. Now, wait a minute. Will you be wanting to get in touch with my husband? No, Mrs. Townsend, that won\\'t be necessary. You mean you\\'re not gonna do any more about this? Roger. Pay the two dollars. Goodbye. - I don\\'t see why you want me along. - You lend a certain air of respectability. Don\\'t be sarcastic, Roger. There you are, dear. Park yourself there. Well, here goes. Ahem. Hello, Operator. Have you got a George Kaplan staying here? That\\'s right. You have? Room 796? Ring it, will you please? You see? I see. I hope he clears up this silly business. - You\\'re ruining my whole day. - Shh, shh. All right. Quiet. Shut up. Oh. Well, did he leave word when he\\'d be back? Really? Thank you. Well, that\\'s odd. He hasn\\'t answered his telephone in two days. Maybe he got locked in the bathroom. Mother, do me a favor, will you? Put on that innocent look you do so well and go to the desk and get the key to 796. Don\\'t be ridiculous. I wouldn\\'t do such a thing. - Ten dollars? - Not for all the money in the world. - Fifty? - Roger, you are disgraceful. Car theft, drunk driving, assaulting an officer, lying to a judge. And now, housebreaking. You\\'re hotel-breaking. There\\'s a difference. - Of five to ten years. Just a minute, please. Will you want me to be changing your bedding, sir? Yes. Well, but not right now. I mention it, because the bed doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s been slept in... ...and I was wondering if I ought to go on changing the linens. - Oh. Thank you for your interest. - You\\'re welcome, sir. Come on, now. Now, she seemed to think I\\'m Kaplan. I wonder if I look like Kaplan. - Oh, well, look who\\'s here. - Who? Where? Our friend who\\'s assembling the General Assembly this afternoon. Roger, I think we should go. - Don\\'t be nervous. - I\\'m not nervous. - I\\'ll be late for the bridge club. - Good. You will lose less than usual. Ooh. - Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff. - In that case, I think we should leave. Too late. - You rang for me, sir? - Yes. Come in a moment. - What\\'s your name? - Elsie, sir. - Elsie, do you know who I am? - You\\'re... You\\'re Mr. Kaplan. Well, when did...? When did you first see me? Outside the door. Out in the hall, a couple of minutes ago. Don\\'t you remember? And that\\'s the first time you laid eyes on me? Can I help it if you\\'re never around, Mr. Kaplan? Well, then, how do you know I am Mr. Kaplan? - What? - How do you know I\\'m Mr. Kaplan? Well, of course you are. This is room 796, isn\\'t it? So you\\'re the gentleman in room 796, aren\\'t you? All right, Elsie, thanks. - Will that be all, sir? - For the time being, yes. Valet. Oh, yes, come in. Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan? Yes, please. Tell me, uh... I forgot, what time did I give you that suit? Last night, around, uh... - Around 6. - Oh. - Did I give it to you personally? - Personally? No. You called down on the phone and described the suit to me... ...and said it would be hanging in your closet. Like you always do. - Anything wrong? - No, no, just curious. - Here. Thanks. - Thank you. Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan. Isn\\x92t that the damnedest thing? I\\'m beginning to think that no one in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan. Maybe he has his suits mended by invisible weavers. Oh... Let me see something. I don\\'t think that one does anything for you. Ah, now, that\\'s much better. Now, obviously they\\'ve mistaken me for a much shorter man. - Should I? - Certainly not. Here, hold that, dear. Hello. It\\'s good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan. Who is this? We met only last night, and still you do not recognize my voice. I should feel offended. Yes, I know who you are, and I\\'m not Mr. Kaplan. Of course not. You answer his telephone, you live in his hotel room... ...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan. Nevertheless, we are pleased to find you in. Now, wait... - Hello, Operator? Operator. Yes? Operator, this is Mr. Thorn... Kaplan in 796. That call. Was that an outside call or did it come from the lobby? Just a minute, sir. I\\'ll see. - Well, hurry, please. Who was it? One of the men who tried to kill me last night. - We\\'re back to that one, are we? - Hello? Operator? Mr. Kaplan? - Yes. That call was made from the lobby, sir. It was? They\\'re probably on their way up here now. - Come on. Let\\'s get out of here. - I think I\\'d like to meet these killers. You gentlemen aren\\'t really trying to kill my son, are you? Lobby, please. Watch your step. Oh, no, gentlemen, please. Ladies first. Come along, ladies. That\\'s right. Come along. Good. Roger. Roger, will you be home for dinner? Where to? - I don\\'t know. Just keep going. - Take me to the United Nations. Right. General Assembly Building. Right. - I\\'m being followed. Can you do anything? - Yes, I can. - Do it. - May I help you, sir? - Yes, please. - Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend? - Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO? - Yes. - And did you have an appointment, sir? Well, yes, yes. He expects me. Your name, please. - My name? - Yes, please. Kaplan. George Kaplan. One moment, please. Wait for me at the corner of 47th. If you\\'ll give this to one of the attendants in the public lounge, she\\'ll page him. - Thank you very much. - You\\'re welcome, Mr. Kaplan. Mr. Bernardi of the Swiss Observers Office. Mr. Bernardi of the Swiss Observers Office. Will you page Mr. Lester Townsend, please? Certainly, Mr. Kaplan. Mr. Townsend of UNIPO. Mr. Townsend of UNIPO. Please call at the communications desk of the public lounge. Mr. Townsend of UNIPO. Please call at the communications desk of the public lounge. Miss Knox of salon... You paged me? - Mr. Kaplan? - Yes. - You wanted to see Mr. Townsend. - Yes. - This is Mr. Townsend. - How do you do, Mr. Kaplan? - This isn\\'t Mr. Townsend. - Yes, it is. There must be some mistake. Mr. Lester Townsend? That\\'s me. What can I do for you? Mr. Mauney, Delegation of Pakistan. Please call the public lounge. Are you the Townsend who lives in Glen Cove? That\\'s right. Are we neighbors? A large, red-brick house with a curved, tree-lined driveway? That\\'s the one. Were you at home last night, Mr. Townsend? - You mean in Glen Cove? - Yes. I\\'ve been staying in my apartment in town for the last month. I always do when we\\'re in session here. What about Mrs. Townsend? My wife has been dead for many years. - Oh, I... - Now, Mr. Kaplan, what\\'s this all about? Forgive me. Who are those people living in your house? What people? The house is completely closed up. Just the gardener and his wife living on the grounds. Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me who you are and what you want. Well, please, just... Look. Do you know this man? Look! He\\'s got a knife. Look out! Listen to me. I had nothing to do with this. Call the police. - Wait a minute. Don\\'t come nearer. Get back. \"The photograph has been identified as that of Roger Thornhill... ...a Manhattan advertising executive, indicating that the name of George Kaplan... ...which he gave to an attendant in the General Assembly Building was false. A possible motive for the slaying was suggested by the discovery... ...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared at Glen Cove police court... ...charged with drunk driving with a stolen car. In his defense, he charged that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend... ...had tried to kill him the night before. \" - Brother. - What about that? Does anyone know this Thornhill? - No, not me. - Never heard of him. Professor? Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken for George Kaplan. How can he get mistaken for George Kaplan when he doesn\\'t even exist? Don\\'t ask me how it happened. Obviously, it happened. Vandamm\\'s men must have grabbed him and tried to put him away... ...using Lester Townsend\\'s house. The unsuspecting Mr. Townsend winds up with a stray knife in his back. So horribly sad. How is it I feel like laughing? What are we going to do? Do? About Mr. Thornhill. We, uh... We do nothing. - Nothing? - That\\'s right. Nothing. Or we could congratulate ourselves on a marvelous stroke of good fortune. Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan, created to divert suspicion... ...from our actual agent, has fortuitously become a live decoy. Yes, professor. And how long do you think he\\'ll stay live? Well, that\\'s his problem. What Mrs. Finley means, is... - Oh, I know what she means. We can\\'t sit back calmly and wait to see who kills him first. Vandamm and company or the police. What can we do to save him without endangering our own agent? Aren\\'t we being just a wee bit callous? No, my dear woman, we\\'re not being callous. We didn\\'t invent our nonexistent man and give him the name of George Kaplan... ...and establish elaborate behavior patterns for him... ...and move his prop belongings in and out of hotel rooms... ...for our own private amusement. We created George Kaplan... ...and labored successfully to convince Vandamm... ...that this was our own agent hot on his trail for a desperately important reason. Check. - Nobody\\'s denying that! Very well, then. If we make the slightest move to suggest there is no such agent as George Kaplan... ...give any hint to Vandamm that he\\'s pursuing a decoy... ...instead of our own agent... ...then our agent, working right under Vandamm\\'s very nose... ...will immediately face suspicion, exposure... ...and assassination. Like the two others who went before. Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are. New York Central Railroad, train number 25... ...the 20th Century Limited... ...due to leave at 6 p. m. For Chicago... ...will depart from plank number 30. - Yes. Yes, dear. I know. Now, listen to me, Mother, I beg you. I called the Plaza. Kaplan checked out. He went to the hotel Ambassador East in Chicago. Yes, that\\'s why I\\'m... Well, I can\\'t go to the police. At least not yet. You saw the newspapers. My fingerprints are on the knife... ...I\\'m a car thief, a drunk driver, and I murdered a man for revenge. I wouldn\\'t have a chance. And I won\\'t have, until I find George Kaplan who obviously knows what this is all about. No, dear, the train. It\\'s safer. Well, because there\\'s no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me. You want me to jump off a moving plane? Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mother. Yeah, well, goodbye. Attention, please. New York Central Railroad, train number 25... ...the 20th Century Limited... ...due to leave at 6 p. m. Yeah. Uh, give me a bedroom on the 20th Century, please. It\\'s leaving in five minutes. - Yes, I know. Could you make it snappy? - I think they\\'re all sold out. - Sold out? You can always go coach. No, I can\\'t do that. What time is the next train? Nothing till 10. You\\'re in a hurry, huh? Well, could you call them and see what they have? Something wrong with your eyes? Yes, they\\'re sensitive to questions. Will you call them? Sure. Sure. Don\\'t go away. He\\'s at Window 15, upper level. Hurry. You\\'re in luck, mister, you... - Ticket? - I\\'m just seeing some friends off. Sorry, I have to know their names before I can let you through. Come here! Hey, come here! Oh. - Oh, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. - My fault. Sorry. He went that way. I think he got off. All aboard! - Thank you. - It\\'s quite all right. - Seven parking tickets. - Oh. Good evening, sir. One? - Please. Cocktail before dinner? - Yes, please. A Gibson. Right away. - Well, here we are again. - Yes. - Do you recommend anything? - The brook trout. A little trouty, but quite good. Sold. Brook trout. - There you are. Thank you. Yes, sir. - I know. I look vaguely familiar. - Yes. You feel you\\'ve seen me somewhere before. Funny how I have that effect on people. It\\'s something about my face. It\\'s a nice face. - You think so? - I wouldn\\'t say it if I didn\\'t. Oh, you\\'re that type. - What type? Honest. Not really. - Good. Because honest women frighten me. Why? I don\\'t know. Somehow, they seem to put me at a disadvantage. - Because you\\'re not honest with them? Exactly. Like that business about the seven parking tickets? Well, what I mean is, the moment I meet an attractive woman... ...I have to start pretending I\\'ve no desire to make love to her. What makes you think you have to conceal it? She might find the idea objectionable. Then again, she might not. Think how lucky I am to have been seated here. Oh, luck had nothing to do with it. Fate? I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here if you should come in. Is that a proposition? I never discuss love on an empty stomach. You\\'ve already eaten. But you haven\\'t. Don\\'t you think it\\'s time we were introduced? I\\'m Eve Kendall. I\\'m 26 and unmarried. Now you know everything. Tell me. What do you do besides lure men to their doom on the 20th Century Limited? I\\'m an industrial designer. Jack Phillips. Western sales manager for Kingby Electronics. No, you\\'re not. You\\'re Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue... ...and you\\'re wanted for murder on every front page in America. And don\\'t be so modest. Whoops. Oh, don\\'t worry. - I won\\'t say a word. - How come? I told you. It\\'s a nice face. Is that the only reason? It\\'s going to be a long night. True. And I don\\'t particularly like the book I\\'ve started. You know what I mean? Let me think. Yes, I know exactly what you mean. There\\'s my trademark. R.O.T. Roger O. Thornhill. What does the \"O\" stand for? Nothing. I\\'d invite you to my bedroom if I had a bedroom. - A roomette? - Nothing, not even a ticket. I\\'ve been playing hide-and-seek ever since the train left New York. - How awkward for you. - Yes, isn\\'t it? No place to sleep. I have a large drawing room all to myself. That doesn\\'t seem quite fair, does it? Drawing room E. Car 3901. Such a nice number. It\\'s easy to remember. Thirty-nine-oh-one. See? No luggage. - So? - Well, you wouldn\\'t happen... ...to have an extra pair of pajamas, would you? Wouldn\\'t I? Incidentally, I wouldn\\'t order any dessert if I were you. I get the message. That isn\\'t exactly what I meant. This train seems to be making an unscheduled stop. And I just saw two men get out of a police car as we pulled into the station. They weren\\'t smiling. I think you better go out and tell those police to hurry. Patience is a virtue. So is breathing. Just lie still. Have you got any olive oil? Olive oil? I want to be packed in olive oil if I\\'m gonna be a sardine. Come in. - Who are you? - State police. Your name please? Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong? There was a man at your table tonight in the dining car. - Yes. Friend of yours? I never saw him before. Is this the man? Yes, I think so. It\\'s not a very clear picture. It\\'s a Wirephoto. We just got it from the New York police. - Police? - He\\'s wanted for murder. Good heavens, no. The steward said you left the dining car together. We might have happened to leave at the same time, but not together. What did you two talk about? Talk about? Your waiter said you were getting along good with this Thornhill. Is that his name? Thornhill? You mean, he didn\\'t tell you? He didn\\'t tell me anything. All we did was chat about different kinds of food... ...train travel versus plane travel, that sort of thing. Rather innocuous, I must say, considering he was a fugitive from justice. - Who did he kill? - He didn\\'t say where he was going, did he? No. I assumed Chicago. You think perhaps he got off when you got on? If you happen to catch sight of him again, Miss, uh... Kendall. Will you let us know? I\\'m going to bed and I intend to lock my door. So I doubt if I\\'ll seeing anybody else tonight. Well, just in case you do, we\\'ll be in the observation car at the rear of the train. It\\'s comforting to know that. Good night. Still breathing? Either hurry up or get me a snorkel. I\\'m looking for the can opener I stole from the porter. Hello, there. Hello. Hmm. Tell me, why are you so good to me? Shall I climb up and tell you why? You know, I\\'ve been thinking, it\\'s not safe for you... ...to roam around Chicago looking for this George Kaplan man... ...you\\'ve been telling me about. You\\'ll be picked up by the police the moment you show your face. Such a nice face too. Now, don\\'t you think it would be a better idea if you stayed in my hotel room... ...while I located him for you and brought him to you? I can\\'t let you get involved. It\\'s too dangerous. I\\'m a big girl. Yeah, and in all the right places too. You know, this is ridiculous. You know that, don\\'t you? Yes. I mean, we\\'ve hardly met. That\\'s right. How do I know you aren\\'t a murderer? You don\\'t. Maybe you\\'re planning to murder me, right here, tonight. Shall I? Please do. Beats flying, doesn\\'t it? We should stop. Immediately. I ought to know more about you. What more could you know? You\\'re an advertising man, that\\'s all I know. That\\'s right. Train\\'s a little unsteady. Who isn\\'t? What else do you know? You\\'ve got taste in clothes, taste in food... And taste in women. I like your flavor. You\\'re very clever with words. You can probably make them do anything for you. Sell people things they don\\'t need... ...make women who don\\'t know you fall in love with you. I\\'m beginning to think I\\'m underpaid. Look out. Oh, porter. - Don\\'t bother with the washroom. - Yes, ma\\'am. By the way, I found this on the floor. Does it belong to you? Yes, ma\\'am. I\\'ve been looking all over for it. - I\\'ll wait outside. - Thank you. Thank you, porter. Thank you, ma\\'am. Good night, now. Good night. Come out, come out, wherever you are. The porter. So I see. Now... ...where were we? - Here. Oh, yes. - Nice of him to have opened the bed. - Yes. - Only one bed. - Yes. That\\'s a good omen, don\\'t you think? Wonderful. Do you know what that means? What? Tell me. It means you\\'re going to sleep on the floor. A message from the lady in 3901. - You keep walking. I\\'ll catch up. - Yes, ma\\'am. - Anything to report, Miss Kendall? - Why, yes. I had a fine night\\'s sleep. No, I mean, have you seen the man we\\'re looking for? - Mr. Thornycroft? - Thornhill. No, no. I\\'m awfully sorry. But good luck to you both. - How are we doing? - Oh, I may collapse at any moment. Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet. Look. Hmm? I\\'m accustomed to having a load on, but what have you got in these bags? - Bowling balls, naturally. - Oh, naturally. - Which one of these has my suit in it? - The small one underneath your right arm. Oh, thanks. That ought to do the suit a lot of good. I\\'m sure Mr. Kaplan won\\'t mind a few wrinkles. Yeah, if he\\'s still there. What time is it? Nine-ten. Nine-ten? Well, he may have left his hotel room by now. I\\'ll call him for you as soon as we get inside the station. No thank you, I can do it. A redcap in a phone booth? Slightly suspicious. I, uh... Well, all right. What are you gonna tell him? Do you know that? Mm-hm. You want to see him right away. Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death. - Mm-hm. Right. - No explanations. While I\\'m calling, you can change your clothes. Where do you propose I do that? In Marshall Field\\'s window? I sort of had the men\\'s room in mind. Did you, now? You\\'re the smartest girl I ever spent the night with on a train. I think we made it. Where did he go? - Which way did he go? - Where did he go? I don\\'t know. He took my clothes. And went that way. Come on. Departing at 10 a. m., Chicago daylight time... ...for Michigan City. Now ready on track number six. Well, what took you so long? Well, I have a big face, small razor. Tell me, did you get Kaplan? - Yes. - Fine. What did he say? Well, he\\'ll see you, but not at the hotel under any circumstances. - He\\'ll see you on the outside. - Well, where? When? - I\\'ve got it all written down for you. - Thanks. Take the Greyhound bus that leaves Chicago... ...for Indianapolis at 2 and ask the driver to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Good. It\\'s about an hour-and-a-half\\'s drive from Chicago. Fine. I\\'ll rent a car. No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus. He wants to be sure you\\'re alone. All right. What\\'ll I do when I get there? Just wait beside the road. He\\'ll be there at 3:30. - Well, how will I know him? - He\\'ll know you. - You made the Chicago papers too. - Oh, yes. Have you got your watch set for Central time? Yes, I did that. Thanks. - What\\'s the matter? - Matter? Yes, you seem... I don\\'t know. You seem tense. You know, you better go before the police run out of redcaps. We\\'ll see each other again, won\\'t we? Sometime, I\\'m sure. I never had a moment to thank you properly. Please go. - Yes, but... But where will I find you? I\\'ve gotta pick up my bags now. Oh, yes. Well, these are the checks for the large cases. Wait a minute. Please. They\\'re coming. Hi. - Hot day. - Seen worse. Are you supposed to be meeting someone here? - Waiting for the bus. Due any minute. - Oh. Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich, if they live long enough. Yeah. And, uh, then your name isn\\'t Kaplan? Can\\'t say it is, because it ain\\'t. Here she comes. Right on time. - That\\'s funny. - What? That plane\\'s dusting crops where there ain\\'t no crops. Get out of here! The other tank may blow! What happened? Hey! Come back! Hey! Come back! Come back! Hey! - Yes? - Uh... Could you let me have Mr. George Kaplan\\'s room number, please? - Kaplan? - Yeah. I think he checked out. - He checked out? - That\\'s right. He checked out at 7:10 this morning. - Seven-ten? Are you sure? - Yes. He left a forwarding address. Hotel Sheraton-Johnson, Rapid City, South Dakota. Seven-ten? Well, then how come I got a message from him at 9...? What\\'s that? Nothing. Nothing. Sorry to bother you again. Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me. She\\'s in room four-something. I\\'ve forgotten the number. Would you mind? - She\\'s in 463. - Oh, yes, that\\'s right. Thanks. Hello. Surprised? Yes. No getting rid of me, is there? I could use a drink. - I have some Scotch. - With water. No ice. How did it go today? The meeting with Kaplan? He didn\\'t show up. Oh? It\\'s funny, isn\\'t it? Why funny? Oh, after all those involved and explicit directions he gave you on the phone. - Maybe I copied them down wrong. - I don\\'t think you got them wrong. I think you sent me to the right place, all right. Why don\\'t you call him back again and see what happened? I did. He checked out. Went to South Dakota. South Dakota? Rapid City. Well, what are you going to do next? I haven\\'t made my mind up yet. It may depend on you. - On me? - Sure. You\\'re my little helper, aren\\'t you? Thank you. To us. To a long and lasting friendship. Meaning, from now on, I\\'m not going to let you out of my sight, sweetheart. I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to. - Oh, no. - I do have plans of my own, you know? And you do have problems. Well, wouldn\\'t it be nice if my problems and your plans were somehow connected? Then we could always stay close to each other... ...and not have to go off in separate directions. Togetherness. You know what I mean? Go ahead, it can\\'t be for me. Hello? Yes. No, not yet. I\\'m not ready. What time? I\\'ll meet you. What\\'s the address? Yes. Goodbye. Business? - Yes. - Industrial-designing business? All work and no play? A girl like you should be enjoying herself this evening... ...instead of taking phone calls from clients. What about having dinner with me? - You can\\'t afford to be seen anyplace. - Well, let\\'s have it up here. Nice and cozy. No, I... I can\\'t. I insist. I want you to do a favor for me. - A big, big favor. - Name it. I want you to leave right now. Stay far away from me and don\\'t come near me again. We\\'re not going to get involved. Last night was last night and that\\'s all there was. That\\'s all there is. There isn\\'t going to be anything more between us. So, please... Goodbye. Good luck. No conversation. Just leave. - Right away? - Yes. No questions asked? Yes. - No, I can\\'t do that. - Please. - After dinner. - Now. After dinner. Fair is fair. All right. On one condition. That you let the hotel valet do something with this suit first. You belong in the stockyards looking like that. Okay. There\\'s the phone. Hello. Valet service, please. Hello, valet? - Oh, this is r... Where are we? - Four sixty-three. Room 463. How quickly can you get a suit sponged and pressed? Yes, fast. Twenty minutes? Fine. Okay, 463. He\\'ll be right up. Better take your things off. Now, what could a man do with his clothes off for 20 minutes? Couldn\\'t he have taken an hour? You could always take a cold shower. That\\'s right. You know, when I was a little boy, I wouldn\\'t even let my mother undress me. - You\\'re a big boy now. - Yes. Tell me, how does a girl like you get to be a girl like you? Lucky, I guess. Oh, not lucky. Naughty. Wicked. Up to no good. Ever kill anyone? Because I bet you could tease a man to death without half-trying. So stop trying, huh? Be with you in a minute. Trousers, please. There you are. Thank you. I think I\\'ll take that cold shower after all. Good. This magnificent pair of Louis XVI fauteuils. Original gilt finish. Upholstered in pure silk damask. How much may I say to start? What am I bid? One hundred. One hundred is bid. Thank you. One-fifty is bid here. Say the 200? Thank you, 200 is bid. Say the 300? I have 300. Four hundred by the little lady. Thank you, sir. Four-fifty is bid for the pair. Can I hear 500? Will you say 500? Can I say the 500? Fair warning and last call. Sold to Mr. Stone, second row. Four hundred and fifty dollars. And now lot number 103. This lovely Aubusson settee. In excellent condition. Please start the bidding. How much? Eight hundred is offered, thank you. Eight hundred is bid. Say the nine? Go 900? Nine hundred is bid. Now, who\\'ll say 1,000? One thousand, thank you. One thousand at 1,000. Say 1,100? - Can I hear 1,100? Selling at $1,000. - The three of you together. Now, that\\'s a picture only Charles Addams could draw. Good evening, Mr. Kaplan. Before we start calling each other names, you better tell me yours. - I haven\\'t had the pleasure. - You disappoint me, sir. I was just going to say that to her. I\\'ve always understood you were a shrewd fellow at your job. What possessed you to come blundering in here like this? Could it be an overpowering interest in art? Yes. The art of survival. Well, have you poured any good drunks lately? One hundred dollars. - He followed me here from the hotel. He was in your room? Sure, isn\\'t everybody? One hundred and fifty. Thank you. Now, say the two. Do I hear two? Two hundred, thank you. Now the three. Do I hear three? Three hundred, anyone? Three hundred, thank you. Now, the four. Do I hear four? Four hundred, anyone? Four hundred is bid. Say the five? I have 400. I have 400. I didn\\'t realize you were an art collector. I thought you just collected corpses. - Five hundred. Five hundred, thank you. I\\'ll bet you paid plenty for this little piece of sculpture. Now the seven. Seven hundred? - Seven hundred. She\\'s worth every dollar of it, take it from me. Now, she puts her heart into her work. In fact, her whole body. Sold to Mr. Vandamm at 700. - Number 106 for your pleasure. - Oh, Mr. Vandamm. Has anyone ever told you that you overplay your various roles rather severely... ...Mr. Kaplan? First, you\\'re the outraged Madison Avenue man... ...who claims he\\'s been mistaken for someone else. Then, you play the fugitive... ...supposedly trying to clear his name of a crime he knows he didn\\'t commit. Now you play the peevish lover, stung by jealousy and betrayal. It seems you fellows could stand less training from the FBI... ...and more from the Actors Studio. Three-fifty I have. Apparently, the only performance that\\'ll satisfy you is when I play dead. Your very next role. You\\'ll be quite convincing, I assure you. Don\\'t lose it for $25. Thank you. Three-seventy-five is bid. I have 375, go the 400. Three-seventy-five, go four? Four hundred is bid. I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter is next on the program. Am I to be dropped into a vat of molten steel... ...and become part of a new skyscraper? Or are you going to ask this female to kiss me again and poison me to death? We offer catalog number 107. Who are you kidding? You have no feelings to hurt. How much to start the bidding on this collector\\'s porcelain? Please start the bidding. Kaplan, we\\'ve had just about enough of you. Then, why don\\'t you send for the police? That\\'s the last thing you\\'d want, isn\\'t it? Me in the hands of the police. There\\'s something I might tell them. That\\'s the reason you had this one hustle me on the train. Something seems to tell me I\\'ve got a better chance if I go to the police. Good night, sweetheart. Don\\'t think it wasn\\'t nice. Say the 12. Twelve hundred dollars there. Twelve hundred is bid. Say 1300? May I hear 1300? They\\'re selling at 1200. Do I hear 1300, please? Last call. Sold. Twelve hundred dollars. Thank you. And now catalog number 109. This superb example of this early 17th century master. It will enhance any collection of fine art. What is your pleasure? How much to start? One thousand dollars. One thousand is bid. Twelve-fifty I have. Now, 1500. Fifteen hundred is bid. Thank you. Seventeen-fifty? - I have 1750. Two thousand dollars. Two thousand is bid. I have 2000. Do I hear 2500? Twenty-five hundred, anyone? Twenty-two-fifty once. Twenty-two-fifty twice. - Last call. - Fifteen hundred. - Well, the bid is already up to 2250, sir. - I still say 1,500. I have 2250. Do I hear 25? - Twenty-two-fifty once, 2250 twice. - Twelve hundred. - Sold for 2250. And now... - Twenty-two-fifty for that chromo? Number 110 in the catalog. A Louis XV carved and gilded lit de repos. Would somebody start the bidding at $750, please? How do we know it\\'s not a fake? It looks like a fake. Well, one thing we know: You\\'re no fake. You\\'re a genuine idiot. Thank you. I wonder if I could respectfully ask the gentleman... ...to get into the spirit of the proceedings. All right. I\\'ll start it at 8. Eight hundred. Thank you. Nine hundred? - One thousand is bid. Go 12? - Eleven. Eleven is bid. Thank you. Go 12. I have 11. Go 12. Who\\'ll say 12? Eleven once. Who\\'ll say 12? Eleven twice. Twelve, thank you. Twelve is bid. I have 12. Go 13. Who\\'ll say 13? Thirteen dollars. You mean 1300, sir. No, no, no, I mean $13. That\\'s more than it\\'s worth. I... I have 1200. Go 13. Who\\'ll say 13? Who\\'ll say 1250? Twelve hundred once, 1200 twice. - Last call. Twelve hundred. - Two thousand. Two thousand? Twenty-one hundred. I\\'m sorry, sir, but we can\\'t... - Make it 2500. Ask him to leave. - Would the gentleman please cooperate? - The last bid was 1200. Twenty-five hundred. My money\\'s as good as anybody\\'s. - Well, isn\\'t it? Isn\\'t it? - I have... - What was it? - Twelve hundred. I have 1200 once, 1200 twice. - Three thousand. Sold for 1200. - I\\'m not gonna let you get away with that. - You\\'d better leave, sir. No, you take your hands off me or I\\'ll sue you. - What took you so long? - Let\\'s take a little walk. - Get moving. - I haven\\'t finished bidding yet. Three thousand. I bid 3000. I\\'m sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying. Not so rough. - Handle with care, fellas. - In there. - I\\'m valuable property. - In. Well, I want to thank you for saving my life. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Save it for the station house. Well, let\\'s have some smiles and good cheer. You\\'re about to become heroes. Don\\'t you know who I am? We\\'ll find out as soon as we book you for being drunk and disorderly. Drunk and disorderly? That\\'s chicken feed. You\\'ve hit the jackpot. Chicago police capture United Nations killer. My name is Roger Thornhill. Here. - It\\'s him. - That\\'s right. Congratulations, man. Yeah. This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm. We\\'ve got a man here who answers to the description of Thornhill, Roger. Code 76. Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID. Absolutely. No question. Michigan Avenue. Proceeding north to 42nd precinct. What? Come again? Are you sure? Okay. Right. Yeah, I got it. One-oh-five-five, off and clear. - Where are we going? - Airport. - For what? - Orders. Airport? I don\\'t wanna be taken to an airport. - I want to be taken to police headquarters. - You do, huh? Why do you think I sent for you? How about this guy, Charlie? He sent for us. - Sit back. - Didn\\'t you hear what I said? I want to be taken to police headquarters. I\\'m a dangerous assassin. - I\\'m a mad killer on the loose. - You ought to be ashamed of yourself. They said right here. Does anyone mind if I sit down? I\\'ve been running all day. Thought I\\'d never make it. Getting too old for this kind of work. All right, men. Thank you. - This way, Mr. Thornhill. - Wait a minute. We haven\\'t much time. Yeah, this way is more private. - I don\\'t think I caught your name. - I don\\'t think I pitched it. You\\'re police, aren\\'t you? Or is it FBI? FBI, CIA, ONI. - We\\'re all in the same alphabet soup. - Really? You can stick this in your alphabet soup. I had nothing to do with that killing. - We know that. - You know it? Then why did you let the police chase me all over the map? We never interfere with the police, unless absolutely necessary. - It\\'s become necessary. - Oh, I see. Well, then, I take it I\\'m going to be cleared. I do wish you\\'d walk faster, Mr. Thornhill. We\\'ll miss the plane. Where are we going? New York or Washington? Rapid City, South Dakota. - Rapid City? What for? - It\\'s near Mount Rushmore. No, thank you. I\\'ve seen Mount Rushmore. So has your friend Mr. Vandamm. Vandamm? A rather formidable kind of gentleman, eh? What about that treacherous little tramp with him? - Miss Kendall? - Yeah. His mistress. We know all about her. Tell me, what\\'s Vandamm up to? Oh, you could say he\\'s a sort of importer-exporter. Of what? Oh. Government secrets, perhaps. Well, then why don\\'t you grab him? There\\'s still too much we don\\'t know about his organization. Oh, I see. What\\'s all this got to do with Mount Rushmore? Well, Vandamm has a place near there. We think it\\'s his jumping-off point to leave the country tomorrow night. - Are you gonna stop him? - No. Well, then what are we going there for? To set his mind at ease about George Kaplan. Oh, you, huh? You\\'re George Kaplan, aren\\'t you? Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill. There is no such person as George Kaplan. What do you mean? I\\'ve been in his room. I\\'ve tried on his clothes. He\\'s got short sleeves and dandruff. Believe me, Mr. Thornhill, he doesn\\'t exist. Which is why I\\'m gonna have to ask you to go on being him for the next 24 hours. Come on. We\\'ll discuss it on the plane. Now, look. You started this decoy business without me, you finish it without me. We might have if you hadn\\'t stumbled into it. You ought to give me a medal instead of asking me to be a target... ...just so your special agent or whatever doesn\\'t get shot at. Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out. Once found out, they\\'re as good as dead. Thanks to you, clouds of suspicion are already forming. Thanks to me? - If you\\'ll get on the plane... - You listen to me. I\\'m an advertising man, not a red herring. I\\'ve got a job, a secretary, a mother... ...two ex-wives and several bartenders dependent upon me... ...and I don\\'t intend to disappoint them all by getting myself killed. The answer is no. - Is that final? - Yes. - Goodbye, then. - Goodbye. If there was a chance of changing your mind I\\'d talk about Miss Kendall. Of whom you so obviously disapprove. Yes, for using sex like some people use a fly swatter. I don\\'t suppose it would matter to you... ...that she was probably forced to do whatever she did to protect herself. To protect herself from what? Exposure and assassination. You see, Mr. Thornhill, she... She\\'s one of our agents. - Oh, no. - I know you didn\\'t mean it... ...but I\\'m afraid you have put her in an extremely dangerous situation. And much more than her life is at stake. - Suppose they don\\'t come? - They\\'ll come. I don\\'t like the way Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me. Perhaps he\\'s trying to give you one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan. Speak soft, and carry a big stick. He\\'s trying to tell me not to go through with this harebrained scheme. He doesn\\'t know to what extent you\\'re the cause of our present trouble. I don\\'t know that I care to accept that charge, professor. Dear, fellow, if you hadn\\'t made yourself so attractive to Miss Kendall... ...that she fell for you... - And vice versa. - Our friend Vandamm wouldn\\'t be losing faith in her loyalty now. It was quite obvious to him last night that she had become emotionally involved. Worst of all, with a man he thinks is a government agent. Are you trying to tell me that I\\'m irresistible? I\\'m trying to remind you it is your responsibility to help us restore her... ...to Vandamm\\'s good graces... ...right up to the point he leaves the country tonight. All right, all right. But, after tonight... My blessings on you both. Here they are. - Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan. - Not her. Did I misunderstand you about bringing her here? We\\'ll get to that later. I suppose you were surprised to get my call. Not at all. I knew the police would release you, Mr. Kaplan. By the way, I want to compliment you on your colorful exit... ...from the auction gallery. Thank you. And now, what little drama are we here for today? I don\\'t for a moment believe that you\\'ve invited me to these gay surroundings... ...to come to a business arrangement. Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact time you\\'re leaving the country tonight... ...but the latitude and longitude of your rendezvous... ...and your ultimate destination. You wouldn\\'t care to carry my bags for me, would you? Perhaps you\\'d be interested in the price, just the same. - The price? - For doing nothing to stop you. How much did you have in mind? I want the girl. I want the girl to get what\\'s coming to her. Turn her over to me, I\\'ll see there\\'s enough pinned on her to keep her... ...uncomfortable for the rest of her life. You do that, and I\\'ll look the other way tonight. She really did get under your skin. We\\'re not talking about my skin. We\\'re talking about yours. - I\\'m offering you a chance to save it. To exchange it. Put it any way you like. I\\'m curious, Mr. Kaplan. What made you arrive at the deduction that my feelings for Miss Kendall... ...have deteriorated to the point where I would trade her in for peace of mind? I don\\'t deduce. I observe. Phillip, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going back to the house now. Just a second, you. Stay away from me. Let go. Let go of me. Stay away from me. Let go. Let go of me. - Now, save the phony tears. - You just get back. - You little fool. - You just stay away from me. No good, sir. You can\\'t get involved in this. - Don\\'t touch anything. - Stand back. Stand back. Mr. Thornhill? Don\\'t be long. Hello. Hello. Are you all right? Yes, I think so. I asked the professor if I could see you again. There\\'s not much time. Isn\\x92t there? I wanted to tell you... I mean, apologize. No need. I understand. All in the line of duty. I did treat you miserably. I, uh... I hated you for it. I didn\\'t want you to go on thinking that I... And I... I used some pretty harsh words. I\\'m sorry. They hurt deeply. - Well, naturally, if I\\'d known... - I couldn\\'t tell you. - Of course not. - Could I? No, I guess not. You didn\\'t get hurt. I\\'m so relieved. - Of course I was hurt. - How would you have felt? - In the cafeteria, when you fell. - When I shot you with the blanks. - Oh, that. No. You did it rather well, I thought. - Yes, I thought I was quite graceful. Considering it\\'s not really your kind of work. Well, I got into it by accident. What\\'s your excuse? I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night and saw only his charm. Oh. I guess I had nothing to do that weekend, so I... I decided to fall in love. Well, that\\'s nice. Eventually, the professor and his Washington colleagues approached me... ...with a few sordid details about Phillip and he told me that... ...my relationship with him made me uniquely valuable to them. So you became a Girl Scout, huh? Maybe it was the first time anyone ever asked me to do anything worthwhile. Has life been like that? How come? Men like you. What\\'s wrong with men like me? They don\\'t believe in marriage. I\\'ve been married twice. See what I mean? I may go back to hating you. It was more fun. Goodbye, darling. - Wait a minute. Not so soon. - No, I gotta get back and convince them... ...that I took the long way around so nobody followed me. Couldn\\'t we stand like this for just a few hours? Just this time you\\'re supposed to be critically wounded. I never felt more alive. Well, whose side are you on? Yours, always, darling. Please don\\'t undermine my resolve just when I need it most. Oh, well, I guess it\\'s off to the hospital for me and back to danger for you. I don\\'t like it a bit. It\\'s much safer now, thanks to you, my darling decoy. Don\\'t thank me. I couldn\\'t stand it. All right. I won\\'t. After your malevolent friend Vandamm takes off tonight... ...you and I are gonna get together and do a lot of apologizing to each other in private. - You know that can\\'t be. - Of course it can be. He has told you, hasn\\'t he? - Told me what? - Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving. - Wait a minute. What didn\\'t you tell me? - Why didn\\'t you? She\\'s going off with Vandamm tonight on the plane. She\\'s going off with Vandamm? We went to such lengths to make her a fugitive from justice. So that Vandamm couldn\\'t very well decline to take her along. I needn\\'t tell you how valuable she can be to us over there. You lied to me. You said that after tonight... - I needed your help. - Well, you got it, all right. Don\\'t be angry. You think I\\'m gonna let you go through with this? - Oh, she has to. - Nobody has to do anything. I don\\'t like the games you play, professor. War is hell, Mr. Thornhill, even when it\\'s a cold one. If you can\\'t lick the Vandamms of this world... ...without asking girls to bed down and fly away with them... ...and never come back... ...perhaps you ought to learn how to lose a few cold wars. I\\'m afraid we\\'re already doing that. - I\\'m not gonna let you do this. Get out. - Please don\\'t spoil everything. Please. Mr. Kaplan twice in full view of horrified men, women and children... ...who had come to the park to see the famed Mount Rushmore monument. Witnesses described Kaplan\\'s assailant as an attractive blonde in her late twenties. Kaplan, who was removed to the Rapid City Hospital in critical condition... ...has been tentatively identified as an employee of the federal government. The tragedy developed with startling suddenness. Chris Swenson, a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria... ...stated that he heard voices raised in... - Here we are. - Hello. Slacks, a shirt and these. Thanks. That\\'ll do for you around here for the next couple of days. For the next couple of days? - Hey. - What? What\\'s this? That\\'s where I hit the chair doing that phony fall in the cafeteria. You and your dopey schemes, shootings. - Otherwise, feeling all right? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Considering your driver has a sledgehammer for a hand. Yeah, I\\'m sorry about that. No, that\\'s all right. I guess I deserved it. I guess I deserve that locked door too. You seen wandering about in good health could\\'ve proved fatal to Miss Kendall. - I\\'ve begun to forget her already. - Good. - Better that way. - Yeah, much. Inside of an hour, she\\'ll be gone. - How\\'s everything out in Rapid City? - Oh, everything\\'s fine. Mr. Kaplan\\'s untimely shooting has now acquired the authority of the printed word. Everyone\\'s been cooperating beautifully. Well, now you can include me. - I\\'m a cooperator. - I\\'m most grateful. - Care to do me a favor in return? - Anything. I\\'d like a drink. Will you get me a...? Get me some bourbon? A pint will do. Can I join you? Well, if you\\'re gonna join me, you better make it a quart. - See you in a few minutes. - Yeah. - Stop. - Oh, excuse me. Stop. - You don\\'t want me to take you up there? - No, thanks. Never mind. Oh, thanks. There\\'s nothing to worry about. I just lost my head. I\\'m not just saying this to make you feel better. I mean it. I just didn\\'t know what I was doing. He wanted to destroy you. You had to protect yourself. But not endanger you. Ah, rubbish. Soon we\\'ll be off together and I shall dedicate myself to your happiness. What\\'s the situation, Leonard? - About the plane, you mean? - Of course. What was the last report? Over Whitestone on the hour, 6000, descending. About ten minutes, huh? At the most. And now, uh... I wonder if I might have a few words of parting with you, sir? Certainly. In private? I\\'ll go up and get my things. Well, Leonard... ...how does one say goodbye to one\\'s right arm? I\\'m afraid you\\'re gonna wish you had cut it off sooner. I know how terribly fond you are of Miss Kendall... I don\\'t find this a terribly attractive... - She is not to be trusted. - You\\'re being mysterious. I\\'m not being mysterious at all. It couldn\\'t have been anything. You must\\'ve had some doubts about her yourself. - And still do. Rubbish. Why else would you have decided not to tell her... ...that our little treasure here has a bellyful of microfilm? You seem to be trying to fill mine with rotten apples. Sometimes the truth does taste like worms. The truth? I\\'ve heard nothing but innuendoes. Call it my woman\\'s intuition if you will, but I\\'ve never trusted neatness. Neatness is always the result of deliberate planning. She shot him in a moment of fear and anger. - You were there yourself. You saw it. Yes. And thereby wrapped everything up into one very neat and tidy bundle. A, she removed any doubts you may have had about her, uh... Now, what did you call it, her devotion? B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason to be taken to the other side with you... ...in case you decided to change your mind. - You know what I think? I think you\\'re jealous. No, I mean it, and I\\'m very touched. Very... Leonard! The gun she shot Kaplan with. I found it in her luggage. It\\'s an old trick. Shoot one of your own to show that you\\'re not one of them. They\\'ve just freshened it up a bit with blank cartridges. What was that noise? Yes, we wondered what it was too. Didn\\'t we, Leonard? Hurry, darling. It\\'s almost time to leave. In a moment. You\\'re not taking her on that plane with you? Of course I am. Like our friends, I too believe in neatness, Leonard. This matter is best disposed of from a great height... ...over water. How about a little champagne before we go? I\\'d love it. It may not be cold enough. Over the rocks will be all right. Are you sure? My dear. Thank you. To you, my dear, and all the lovely moments we\\'ve had together. Thank you, Phillip. There he is. Jump in, Leonard. The champagne\\'s fine. There isn\\'t time. You always were a spoilsport, weren\\'t you? One of my most valuable attributes as it now turns out. It would please me if you would think of me as being along on this journey... ...if only in spirit. I shall, Leonard. He\\'s heading pretty far out on the north leg and awfully high. I guess he\\'s gonna play it safe with a long, slow descent. You couldn\\'t ask for a better night than this. Ceiling and possibilities unlimited. Ah, there he goes, starting his turn. Well, we better get moving. He should have his wheels on the ground inside of three minutes. - Come along, Eve. All right. I think I left my earrings upstairs. I\\'ll be right down. We can get out through the window. There\\'s a car. What are you doing? You\\'ll ruin everything. They know about the shooting. They\\'re going to do away with you! - What are you talking about? - Leonard found the gun in your luggage. The figure they got at the auction is filled with microfilm. - That\\'s how he\\'s been getting it. Miss Kendall? Whatever you do, don\\'t get on that plane. Don\\'t worry, Anna. Arrangements have been made. You and your husband will be over the Canadian border by morning. Thank you very much, sir. - Be careful. We will, sir, and God bless you. Thank you for everything. Be careful, now. Now, you\\'re not gonna leave the house until we\\'re... I\\'ll wait, sir. I certainly will. Safe journey. Thank you very much. Bye. Stay where you are. Sit down. As soon as the plane leaves, my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back. What is it? I was wondering about my earrings. They\\'ll turn up. When you return to New York, say goodbye to my sister for me. And thank her for her superb performance as Mrs. Townsend. I\\'ll do that. Tell your knife-throwing chum... ...that I\\'ve reassured his wife. All right. - That\\'s about all, Leonard. Get that figure back from her. The housekeeper had me pinned down... ...before I realized it was that same silly gun of yours. - I see you\\'ve got the pumpkin. - Yes. This is no good. We\\'re on top of the monument. What do we do? Climb down. We can\\'t. Here they come. We have no choice. Well, if we ever get out of this alive... ...let\\'s go back to New York on the train together. All right? Is that a proposition? It\\'s a proposal, sweetie. What happened to the first two marriages? My wives divorced me. - Why? - Well, I think they said I led too dull a life. - Ha, ha. - Come on. You all right? All right, all right. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Help. Help me. Thank you, sergeant. That wasn\\'t very sporting, using real bullets? Here, reach. Now. - I\\'m trying. - Come on, I\\'ve got you. - Up. - I can\\'t make it. Yes, you can. Come on. - Pull harder. - Come along, Mrs. Thornhill. - Oh. Roger, this is silly. - I know, but I\\'m sentimental.

The fire department was the first on the scene. Kerry. Is it him? - Before you go in there... Eric. Is it him? We don\\'t know yet. It\\'s not Detective Matthews. What happened?

All he had to do was release himself from each of the chains... walk out the door before it went off. All he had to do? Uhh! Oh, God! Fuck! Fuck! Oohh! I really had this feeling it was going to be him. Kerry, Eric is a missing persons case, not a homicide case. I\\'ve been having nightmares where I see him. I\\'m never going to be able to forgive myself for what happened. Listen, it\\'s not your fault. It\\'s always somebody\\'s fault. That somebody isn\\'t you. That someone is still out there. So put all your anger into finding them and putting them away. All right? What I don\\'t understand is how the hell could Jigsaw do all of this? He was damn near on his deathbed the last time we saw him. I\\'m not so sure he did. So far this doesn\\'t follow any of his patterns. Meaning? Well...how\\'d you get in here? We cut the door down. Why? Because somebody heard an explosion and called us. I mean, why did you have to cut the door down? It was welded shut. Bloody truck couldn\\'t get in here. Exactly. I don\\'t follow. If the aim of Jigsaw\\'s game was to get out before the bomb went off, then why was the door welded shut? The guy couldn\\'t get out if he wanted to. You won\\'t believe this.

What is this place?! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! What is...this place? Who are you? Who are you? Hello, Dr. Denlon. You may not remember me, but I most certainly remember you. I was a guest at your hospital once. Where am I? Do you remember me? I\\'ve seen you on television. Lawrence Gordon was your doctor. I was his patient, and he was mine. As you can see from that report, my prognosis isn\\'t good. Would you agree? There\\'s no preventative treatment for what you have. I remember you saying that to me once before in almost the exact same tone. Leave it to a doctor to find such a cold, clinical way of saying I\\'m a dead man walking. Looking at me, how long would you say I have left? I\\'d have to examine you. Even then, a frontal lobe tumor is unpredictable. The growth depends on the rate of mitosis versus apoptosis-- I\\'m sorry, but there\\'s all this crude medical equipment around me causing you to believe that you\\'re still inside a hospital. No. - Then why are you speaking to me in that graduate school medical jargon? Look at me! Aaahh! Aah! Uhh! Now, you look at me. I asked you a simple question. Based on your experience, how long do you think I have left? It\\'s not a simple answer. Based on your file, I\\'d say...not long. Death is a surprise party. Unless, of course...you\\'re already dead on the inside. Unless you\\'re the type of person who swallows antidepressants to hide the pain, huh? Turns their back on their husband. Neglects their child. Who has every possible advantage in life but chooses not to advance. What do you want from me? What do I want? I want to play a game. The rules of the game are simple. The consequences for breaking them are great. Death. You\\'re being tested. Your will is being tested. Your will to keep someone alive. Can you do that? Can you follow the rules and grant someone the gift of life? - What is this? No! Get it--aah! No! No! What is this! What are you doing to me? Aah! Aah! The device that you\\'re wearing is linked to my heart rate monitor. The second that heart rate monitor flatlines or you move out of range, an explosion will go off in that collar. Your life and my life will end simultaneously. Please. Please don\\'t do this to me. I have a family. I have a family. Let me give you the simple version. You will keep him alive, whatever it takes. No excuses. No equivocations. No crying. What do you mean, keep him alive? Out there, on those screens, we have another test subject. A man. He will face a series of tests. You have to keep John alive until he makes it through. If he completes all of his tests and John is still breathing, then I will remove your collar... ...and you\\'re free to go. Uhh! You\\'re a vital piece of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon. A critical part of what could be my final test. Amanda, it\\'s time to start our game. Help! Hello! Is there anybody out there? <i>Hello, Jeff.</i> <i>Over the past few years, you have become a shell of your former self...</i> <i>consumed with hatred</i> <i>and vengeance.</i> <i>Vengeance against the drunk driver who killed your only son.</i> <i>Vengeance against the killer,</i> <i>who to your surprise</i> <i>and dismay, was set free</i> <i>after a hasty trial.</i> <i>Today, however, it is you</i> <i>who will be put on trial.</i> <i>To escape from where you are, you will have to face a series of tests.</i> <i>You will have to suffer to move forward through each of them.</i> <i>But with each one, you</i> <i>will also have a chance...</i> <i>a chance to forgive.</i> <i>When you complete the tests,</i> <i>I promise you you will</i> <i>finally come face to face</i> <i>with the man responsible</i> <i>for the loss of your child.</i> <i>That will be</i> <i>your ultimate test.</i> <i>Can you forgive him?</i> <i>You better hurry, though.</i> <i>In two hours,</i> <i>the doors will lock,</i> <i>and this place</i> <i>will become your tomb.</i> <i>This is what you\\'ve</i> <i>been waiting for, Jeff.</i> <i>Let the game begin.</i> You fucking killed my son. Don\\'t you fuckin\\' beg. Do you know who I am? I\\'ll fuckin\\' teach you, you motherfucker. This is what you fuckin\\' deserve. Where is it? What? Where is it? How many times? How many times do I have to tell you before you get it in your head? I just wanted to sleep with something. No. No. You just--nothin\\'. You don\\'t...touch things in Dylan\\'s room. Okay? I\\'m sorry, Daddy. You know I love you, don\\'t you? Mm-hmm. What do you think Mommy would say if she saw us like this? I\\'m gonna go get ready for school. <i>Daddy!</i> Unh. Hello? Hello? Hey! All right, John. I need you to look at my nose. Right here. Look at my nose, please? Follow my flashlight. Tell me if you feel any pain, all right? That hurt? It\\'s begun. He\\'s out of the box. So? My 20-second analysis without any medical equipment is that his brain\\'s herniating. Oh. He needs to go to the hospital and have an operation to decompress his brain. Come here. No, really. Come here. - What? Come here. - No. Did I bring John to you... or did I bring your self-centered ass to him? You better start fuckin\\' paying attention. No one\\'s going to any hospital. I can\\'t perform miracles. You\\'re--You\\'re giving him painkillers. For a tumor like this, he needs steroids, Prednisone. Oh, good. Yeah. Maybe we could try some corticoid steroids, you know, like Dexamethasone. Why don\\'t you fuckin\\' tell me something that I don\\'t know, you stupid cunt? The only place that he can get those drugs is in a hospital. Or else he\\'s gonna die. You are not a good listener. I think you missed the part that if <i>he</i> dies... <i>...you</i> die. I\\'m not asking you. He is. He chose you. Not me. - Amanda! Our doctor can\\'t do what\\'s being asked of her if you\\'re threatening her. The rules of our game have been made very clear. You need to abide by those rules. Sorry. Amanda! Amanda, I need your help! Amanda, he needs oxygen! Oxygen, Amanda! Put the mask on his face. Okay, now hold him down. Tip his head to the side. You got it? What are you doing?! Ativan! Do you have Ativan?! No! Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Stay with me, John. You\\'re almost through this. Stay with me. Stay with me. We\\'re almost done with this. Was that enough for you? Are you ready to go to the hospital now? He needs to have an operation. Okay. Okay. But we do it here. We do it here. - What? What do you need? I need anesthetic for a procedure like this. Anesthetic. What else? Even with an anesthetic-- Anesthetic! What else? A power drill. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Please, please. Let me go. Please. Why...Why are you doing this to me? Don\\'t...Don\\'t kill me. Okay? Please! Wait. The key. Key. Key. Okay. Come on. Fuck! Fuck! Please. I\\'m so cold. I can\\'t feel my arms. <i>Welcome to your</i> <i>first test, Jeff.</i> <i>For the past three years,</i> <i>you\\'ve cursed the name</i> <i>of all those you thought</i> <i>were responsible</i> <i>for the death</i> <i>of your son.</i> <i>You fantasize those</i> <i>accountable will pay.</i> <i>Well, you will find</i> <i>a woman in front of you</i> <i>chained in place. This will</i> <i>prevent her from running...</i> <i>much like she did</i> <i>on the day your son was hit.</i> <i>Her name is Danica Scott.</i> <i>She was the only</i> <i>witness present</i> <i>at the scene of your</i> <i>son\\'s untimely demise.</i> <i>If not for her own</i> <i>self-absorption and cowardice,</i> <i>she could have brought</i> <i>your son\\'s killer to justice.</i> <i>Now it is you</i> <i>who has a chance</i> <i>to bring</i> her <i>to justice.</i> <i>You alone can grant her</i> <i>the gift of life</i> <i>before she freezes to death.</i> <i>Behind the pipes</i> <i>on the back wall</i> <i>you will find the key that</i> <i>will free her and bring you</i> <i>one step closer to the man</i> <i>responsible for the loss</i> <i>of your child.</i> <i>Will you claim the key</i> <i>to save only yourself...</i> Help me. <i>...or can you find it</i> <i>within you to save another?</i> <i>Make your choice.</i> I didn\\'t do anything. I didn\\'t do anything to you! That\\'s exactly it. You didn\\'t do anything. I\\'m fucking...dying. He died! In my arms. My eight-year-old son died in my arms. I made a m-m-mistake. I\\'m so sorry. I\\'m human. I\\'m human, just like your son was. Okay? Look at me. I said, look at me. Look.... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It\\'s--It\\'s cold. Ohhh! Fuck you! Oh, God. Aaahh! Amanda, if you really care about John, you won\\'t let me do this to him. I mean, you\\'re a smart woman, and you know what\\'s right for him. I\\'m sorry. I know it\\'s hard to concentrate when you\\'re surrounded by so many things you could kill me with, like this ax I saw you lookin\\' at. Take it. Please, it\\'s yours. Come on. I\\'d go for the neck, but I\\'m not the brain surgeon. Just do it quietly so John doesn\\'t hear me die. Otherwise he\\'s likely to get upset, rip off his heart rate monitor. - Boom. Then you just have to find the sensor and disarm it so you can walk more than 30 feet out that door without the collar detonating. Or you could try and take the collar off yourself. But that could be tricky. The slightest knock in the wrong place could trigger it. I should know. I built it. So. Do you have everything you need? I have the instruments to cut someone open. I don\\'t have the tools to save a life. You\\'d be surprised what tools can save a life. <i>Hello, Amanda.</i> <i>You don\\'t know me,</i> <i>but...I know you.</i> <i>I want to play a game.</i> <i>There is only one chance</i> <i>to open the device.</i> <i>In the stomach</i> <i>of your dead cellmate.</i> <i>Look around, Amanda.</i> <i>Know that I\\'m not playing.</i> <i>Live or die.</i> <i>Make your choice.</i> <i>Congratulations.</i> <i>You are still alive.</i> <i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive,</i> <i>but not you,</i> <i>not anymore.</i> Amanda, do not be afraid. <i>Your life has just begun.</i> He made it through the freezer room.

The last time I saw him, we were so disconnected. But now... ...I\\'d give... anything in the world... ...to see my husband. Matrimony\\'s always fascinated me. Husbands barely able to look at their wives, wives on their backs in motel rooms with perfect strangers, people who bear children only to neglect them. Till death do us part, indeed. I don\\'t know what you think you know, but my marriage has survived more suffering than someone like you could ever grasp. Suffering? You haven\\'t seen anything yet. Someone like me? Who am I? A monster. A murderer. I don\\'t condone murder, and I... despise murderers. Please. Please...let me go. We\\'re fine, Amanda. We don\\'t need you. I said, we\\'re fine. If you make it through this, Lynn, you\\'re gonna thank me one day just as Amanda did. <i>Please, let me go.</i> I saved your life. Maybe my life isn\\'t the one you were saving after all. Tell me about your daughter. I understand she\\'s quite a little athlete. Or we could talk about your son. What did you say? Why are you living with the dead when you have such a beautiful family, <i>a husband who</i> <i>is indeed alone,</i> <i>a daughter who needs</i> <i>her mother,</i> <i>patients who need</i> <i>a competent physician</i> who looks them in the eye and treats them like human beings? He\\'s completed the third test. Congratulations, Lynn. You\\'re free to go. Yeah, but he\\'s not all the way out yet. Undo her collar, Amanda, and let her go. No, he\\'s not finished. He\\'s not all the way. Amanda, Lynn is more important than you know. Unlock her collar and let her go. I said no. Amanda, there are rules. She doesn\\'t deserve to go free. You promised. I didn\\'t promise you shit. Amanda, even with that gun, it is Lynn who holds your life in her hand. Fuck you. You give her control over me? Fuck you! I won\\'t tell anyone. I promise I won\\'t. Please, I have a family. Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up! And stop fuckin\\' moving around! What about the other test subjects that we left alive? Game over. - I\\'ll fuckin\\' kill you! What about them? Was that how you felt about them? <i>Was that how you felt</i> <i>about Eric Matthews?</i> Eric Matthews. Let me go. I\\'ll tell you how I felt about Eric Matthews. Daniel! Fuck. Fuck! - Damn you! Daniel! Fuck! Fuck. Aaaahhh! Where\\'s Daniel? Where\\'s my son? Where is he, you junkie bitch? Fuck you. Where is he?! Tell me where he is. Tell me where he is. Right fuckin\\' here. You bitch! You\\'re nothin\\', bitch! You\\'re nothing! You\\'re not Jigsaw. You\\'re not Jigsaw, bitch! You hear me? You\\'re nothing! You\\'re not Jigsaw, bitch. You\\'re nothin\\'! I\\'ll fuckin\\' kill you! No! That\\'s right. I\\'m a murderer. He took my life from me, so I just returned the fuckin\\' favor. No, Amanda, that\\'s what you thought, but I know different. You left him for dead, didn\\'t you? Stop fucking with me. But I cleaned up your mistakes. I forgave you for them. Let me go! Please! <i> What you do is</i> <i>no different than murder.</i> <i>You torture people.</i> <i>You watch them die.</i> But now you\\'re begging me not to kill this worthless bitch on the grounds of some game? You are walking us toward a precipice, Amanda. Step back. It\\'s bullshit. <i>Nobody changes.</i> <i>It\\'s all a lie.</i> If you fail in this, we all fail. Succeed, and we all succeed. It\\'s a lie! I\\'ll tell you, she hasn\\'t changed, because nobody fuckin\\' changes. Nobody is reborn. It\\'s all bullshit! It\\'s all a fuckin\\' lie! And I\\'m just a pawn in your stupid games. I don\\'t mean anything to you. No, you mean everything to me. Fuck you! Our fates are linked. I\\'ve tried to help you, Amanda. So, help me! Fix me! Fix me, motherfucker! I\\'m standin\\' right here. Why is she so important to you? She\\'s not important to me. She\\'s important to <i>you.</i> She\\'s not important to me. I beg you to reconsider that. This is your last chance, Amanda. She\\'s nothing. Your time\\'s running out. Now, you think about what you\\'re doing. <i>Think about everything</i> <i>that you\\'ve done.</i> You think about what you promised me. <i>Think about our dreams.</i> Think about tomorrow. Lynn? Jeff! Jeff-- Lynn. Lynn. Lynn. - Jeff. You just destroyed four lives. You just murdered Jeff\\'s wife. Unhh! Unhh! Baby. Amanda. It\\'s okay. This was <i>your</i> test... ...your game. What do I want? I want to play a game. You\\'re being tested. Your will is being tested-- <i> Your will to keep</i> someone alive. Can you do that? <i>Can you</i> <i>follow the rules</i> and grant someone the gift of life? I was testing you. I took you in. You will give everything to me. Yes. <i>I selected you for the honor</i> <i>of carrying on</i> <i>my life\\'s work.</i> <i>But you didn\\'t.</i> That\\'s right. I\\'m a murderer. I despise murderers. You didn\\'t test anyone\\'s will to live. Game over. <i>Instead you took away</i> <i>their only chance.</i> <i>Your games were unwinnable.</i> <i>Your subjects merely victims.</i> There is no turning back. Do you understand that? <i>In my desperation, I decided to give you one last chance.</i> <i>So I put</i> <i>everything in place.</i> You chose her \\'cause she\\'s the best, right? That\\'s one reason I chose her. <i>You didn\\'t know that Lynn and Jeff were husband and wife.</i> <i>I had to keep that from you</i> <i>for the purposes of my game.</i> <i>I had to leave out</i> <i>the ruined marriage,</i> <i>the cheating wife,</i> <i>the vengeful husband,</i> <i>the neglected daughter.</i> <i>And I let you make</i> <i>your own choices.</i> I wanted you to succeed. Amanda, put it away. Trust me, even with that gun, it\\'s Lynn who holds your life in her hands. She\\'s not important to me. Unlock her collar and let her go. I said no! The rules of our game have been made very clear. We need to abide by those rules. You couldn\\'t. God. Game over. You haven\\'t learned anything tonight, have you? Your rage and your vengeance will only hurt the ones you love. Killing me will only add to your misery. It will not bring back your son. Think of your daughter, Jeff. She needs you now more than ever. You can\\'t kill me, Jeff. Your wife\\'s dying, Jeff. Her time\\'s running out. Jeff, do not miscalculate. Your fate is in my hands. Your wife\\'s fate is in my hands. I love you. I love you. I\\'m taking you home. Okay? Though you may not see any threat... there are threats all around you. Jeff, if you try to move your wife, she will die. I can have an ambulance here in four minutes. Would you like to take your wife out of here tonight? Would you like to take her to safety? Stay. Stand and face me, Jeff. Stay with me, please. - Right now. Would you like to get your life back? Would you, Jeff? I can make that happen. Which is it, Jeff? Come on...yes or no? Yes. What do you want? One final test. The rules are simple. Over on that table, there\\'s a host of vicious implements... ...which you can use to exact your pound of flesh, to take your vengeance, to indulge your obsession. Or you can choose to put your vengeance aside, and you can forgive. You can forgive me for the pain that I\\'ve caused you and your wife tonight. Jeff. Which is it gonna be, Jeff? Honey, don\\'t do it. Jeff... It\\'s up to you. I need you. Live or die, Jeff? Make our choice. I forgive you. Jeff... Jeff. Jeff! I forgive you. <i>Hello, Jeff.</i> <i>I made this tape as an insurance policy, if you will.</i> Jeff! <i>And if you\\'re</i> <i>listening to it,</i> <i>then it\\'s time to collect.</i> <i>I was your final test</i> <i>of forgiveness.</i> <i>And if you are</i> <i>listening to this,</i> <i>then you failed.</i> <i>Now you must pay</i> <i>the price...</i> the price for living <i>for nothing but vengeance.</i> <i>Now I will give you</i> <i>something to live for.</i> <i>I told you that</i> <i>you couldn\\'t kill me, Jeff,</i> <i>but I didn\\'t tell you why,</i> <i>and the answer is simple.</i> <i>I am the person responsible for the loss of your child.</i> I am the only person who knows where your daughter is. <i>She only has a limited</i> <i>supply of air, Jeff,</i> <i>and if you want</i> <i>to get her back,</i> <i>you\\'ll have to play a game.</i> Jeff!

So far, in what could loosely be called your life... you\\'ve made a living watching others. Society would call you an informant, a rat, a snitch. I call you unworthy of the body you possess... of the life that you\\'ve been given. Now, we will see if you are willing to look inward... rather than outward... To give up the one thing you rely on... in order to go on living. The device around your neck is a death mask. The mask is on a spring timer. If you do not locate the key in time... the mask will close. Think of it like a Venus flytrap. What you are looking at right now is your own body... not more than two hours ago. - Oh, fuck. - Don\\'t worry. You\\'re sound asleep and can\\'t feel a thing. Taking into account that you are at a great disadvantage here... I am going to give you a hint as to where I\\'ve hidden the key. So listen carefully. The hint is this... it\\'s right before your eyes. How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Michael? Live or die. Make your choice. Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?! Who the fuck are you?! No! No more! Someone help me! Fuck! Do it! Fuck! Help me! Please! Please! Fuck! Please! No, no, no, no, no, no! - \\'Scuse me. - Help you? Here for Daniel Mathews. Sign these. Thanks. Let\\'s go, Daniel. Took you long enough. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t have it penciled in on my schedule. They\\'re gonna press charges, you know. Yeah. They\\'re assholes. Course they are. You stole from them. This works out great for me, though. Your mother gets to keep custody, I get to take you <i>into</i> custody. What is it with you? You a tough guy \\'cause you steal now? Please, save me the after school special. - Why are you such a cop 24/7? - Hey, it\\'s called being a father. Trust me, you\\'re better at being a cop. I just think I should go back to Mom\\'s early. - What did you say? - What, can you not hear me? No, I can\\'t hear you. Say it again. I think I should go back to Mom\\'s... Well, then go! Jesus. Hey, this is Daniel. Leave a message. It\\'s Dad. Sorry about yesterday. Look, I haven\\'t heard from you. Would you give me a call, please? Daniel. I\\'m sorry, sarge. I thought you were my son. Yeah. I\\'ll be right there. What do you got? County asbestos cleaners were working on a deadline. One of them finds a body, calls it in. Says that this whole section\\'s been abandoned for two years. Spotted people down here, though. - Who? - Well, homeless, mostly. Bunch of kids held a rave in the boiler room about two months back. Get an estimate on the time of death? Forensics just got here. But it was the arriving officer who called it in as your buddy. He wasn\\'t my buddy, he was an informant. This officer I.D.\\'d him just by looking at him? Well, he wasn\\'t positive. That\\'s why I wanted you here. All right. Let me get a look at his face. I\\'ll tell you in two seconds if it\\'s him or not. Therein lies the problem. Yeah, that\\'s Mike. When were you gonna tell me about that? Thought you\\'d want to see it for yourself. OK. Well, I saw it. I\\'ll have to admit it\\'s a little early, but... so far, everything matches Jigsaw\\'s pattern. I can see that. What do you want with me? Let\\'s just pretend for a second that this is new to us, all right? Can you think of anyone that would want to do this to your guy? Well, he\\'s an informant, Kerry. You want a list of possible suspects? Grab a phone book. Crackhead county punks don\\'t have engineering degrees. Now, I\\'d say that our cause of death here... narrows that list down just a little bit, wouldn\\'t you? Sure. And you\\'re the expert. Look closer, Detective Mathews. At what? Ask whoever wrote it. Hello, Michael. I want to play a game. So far, in what could loosely be called your life... you have made a living watching others. You know, you and that guy have a lot in common, Kerry. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Both like playing games with people. Excuse me? Don\\'t ever pull some shit like that again on me at a crime scene. Look, I\\'m not the one taunting you. He is. Doesn\\'t mean I have to take the bait. Besides, I got a full caseload as it is. A bunch of desk errands and shit work. Yeah, well, between that, I.A. breathing down my neck... my son\\'s budding criminal career, and my wife\\'s fucking divorce lawyers... I\\'d say my hands are pretty full, wouldn\\'t you? Yeah. Look, I\\'m sorry. I was hoping, maybe, that I could bring you in on this one. We\\'re not partners anymore, Kerry. Forget that we\\'re not partners, what about the fact... that this guy wrote your fucking name on the wall, huh? He asked for you. It\\'s not the first time some psychopath called me out. All right. What about the fact that I\\'m asking? Can\\'t help you. - Wow. - You\\'re the Jigsaw expert. When did you stop being a cop? Look closer, Detective Mathews. This guy wrote your fucking name on the wall. Look closer, Detective Mathews. He asked for you. All right, fellas. Listen up. These are the best entry points. They\\'re the ones with direct street frontage... vehicle access, and good cover. Now remember... we\\'re doing this in broad daylight. We don\\'t want to scare any civilians. I\\'ve been there before, I know the location. Just bust in there... and scare the shit out of anyone who happens to be inside, OK? Going in teams of three. I\\'ll go with Team Alpha. Let\\'s do this. Just like the good old days, huh? Thought your caseload was big enough as it is. Just tagging along for the ride. Go, go, go, go, go. Help team, I want you in front. Baker, flank the side. Let\\'s do this. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. Keep moving, keep moving. Clear, clear, clear. Alpha\\'s up first. Freeze! What the fuck? Man down! Officer down, officer down! - The fucking place is wired! - Officer down! Officer down! Fuck this. Second team, get in here now! - Go, go, go! - Second team, get here. Guys. Talk to me, guys. Go. Go. Officer down. Move him out. Move him out. Clear, clear, clear. Let\\'s go. Move out! Freeze! Don\\'t move. Let me see your hands! Not gonna ask again! Put your hands where I can see them! Down on your knees! Down on your knees! I\\'m afraid I can\\'t do that. Get him in restraints, now. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you can\\'t afford one... one will be appointed to you by the city. He\\'s clean! Hey. Is this close enough? Get his ass out of here. Actually, I will need to remain here... while you deal with your problem, Detective Mathews. What problem? The problem in that room. You keep him secure. Clear. Shit. - What? - I don\\'t know. Shit. I think that\\'s my son. Fuck. He\\'s got my son. What the fuck is that? Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that? It\\'s your son Daniel. You remember him, don\\'t you? I know who he is, you piece of shit. What is he doing on that fuckin\\' monitor? Well, I haven\\'t looked at the monitors for some time... so it\\'d be hard for me to say. But I would imagine that, um... he\\'s cowering in a corner with a look on his face... - You motherfucker! - No, Eric. Wait. You motherfucker! Where is he? Where is he?! Where is he? That\\'s a problem you\\'re gonna have to solve... before it\\'s too late. He has about two hours... before the gas creeping into his nervous system... begins to break down his body tissue... and he begins to bleed from every orifice he has. Oh, yes. There will be blood. Tell me where he is. He\\'s in a safe place. Eric. I need a phone. Eric, just listen to me for a second. Just give me a phone! Look, everything about this fits his profile. I need to be sure. You\\'ve reached Daniel\\'s phone. He\\'s not in right now. But if you\\'d leave... I\\'m sorry. We have something counting down over here. Get me bomb squad now. Hey. Hey, wake up. Hey. Can you hear me? She\\'s still breathing. What is this, house arrest? - We in jail? - No. This ain\\'t jail, man. Yeah, you done a lot of time? Yeah. Too much. Somebody open the fucking door! I don\\'t think anybody\\'s listening. Damn. What the fuck is this? Somebody\\'s listening. No. Those types of cameras don\\'t have sound. Fuck! Fuck! How do you just wake up in a room and have no idea where you are? I guess you never been drunk before. I\\'ve been drunk. I spent three years at college. Drunk... this isn\\'t drunk. This is kidnapping. Look, I saw this movie on TV last week. This guy, he was a reporter, and he goes into this war zone, right? He goes to sleep in his hotel room the first night. Bam! He wakes up the next morning. He\\'s in a cell with no windows and no light. And he spent nine years in that room. Nine years? Man, that\\'s nothing. Get over it. What do you mean, get over it? I mean stop bitching about it and let\\'s do something. I think we should all just calm down. Shut up! Shut up! I hear something. What is it? It\\'s ticking. I hear ticking. Hey. Hey. Hey. Calm down. Calm down. What\\'s your name? Amanda. - Where am I? - I don\\'t know. Nobody knows. We all just woke up here like you. No! No! - No! - It\\'s OK. No! Fuck! What? What are you looking for? What is this? Everything you need to know is on this. Greetings and welcome. I trust that you are all wondering where you are. I can assure you that, while your location is not important... what these walls offer for you <i>is</i> important... salvation, if you earn it. Three hours from now, the door to this house will open. Unfortunately, you only have two hours to live. Right now you are breathing in a deadly nerve agent. You\\'ve been breathing it since you arrived here. Those of you familiar with the Tokyo subway attacks... will know its devastating effects on the human body. The only way to overcome it and walk out that door... is to find an antidote. Several are hidden around this house. One is inside the safe in front of you. You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind. The clues of their order can be found over the rainbow. Once you realize what you all have in common... you will be in a better understanding of why you\\'re here. \"X\" marks the spot for that clue, so look carefully. Let the game begin. - Who is this? - What does he mean, gas? And how did you know where to find this? This is bullshit. \"Do not attempt to use this key on the door to this room.\" Fuck this, man. Yeah, fuck this. That\\'s a good idea. No, no. That\\'s not a good idea. So what are we gonna do, huh? Sit here? The note said not to use the key. Who gives a shit about the note, all right? This is all a fuckin\\' big goddamn joke. And I\\'m about to end it. You better start talking right now. - What is this? - It\\'s a game. Ain\\'t no fuckin\\' game! My man just got his head blown off! - He\\'s testing us. - Who\\'s testing us? - Jigsaw. - Who the hell is Jigsaw? You don\\'t watch the fuckin\\' news? - No. Who is he? - He\\'s a serial killer. No, he\\'s not. He\\'s testing us. He wants us to survive this. But you have to play by the fucking rules! I\\'m gonna ask you again. How do you know all this? Because I\\'ve played before. I want a tech team in here now. Find out where that feed is coming from. What do you want with me? A little of your time, detective. I don\\'t have any time. You asked me what I wanted, and I told you. Believe me when I tell you your son is in a lot of trouble. And what if I give you a little bit of my time, what then? I only want to talk to you. Everyone else must leave. Those are my conditions. No. It\\'s a crime scene, nobody leaves. They don\\'t have to leave the building, they just have to leave this area... long enough for me to talk to you. If you agree to that, then you will see your son again. If I don\\'t see my son again... I swear to God, I\\'ll rip your fuckin\\' head off. I don\\'t intend to mock you, officer... but I\\'m a cancer patient. How could you possibly put me in any more pain... than I\\'m already in? Just get them here now. All right, tech team\\'s on the way. Should have your signal traced within an hour, maybe two. He said he wants to talk to me alone. Well, maybe you should talk to him. Well, fuck that. Five minutes, old-school method. He\\'s not gonna respond to the phone book treatment, you know that. Don\\'t underestimate a tried and true method here. I am the one who\\'s been working on this case from day one. I have been spending every waking moment piecing it together. Maybe that\\'s why you ain\\'t got a goddamn family for yourself... and you can\\'t understand what this man is going through. Look... I don\\'t want to talk to him. Listen, you already lost your son one time before... because you got involved with me. It\\'s not gonna happen again. This is bullshit. What are we gonna do? Just humor him, buy us a little more time. We can win this, Eric. We can beat him. All right. Find an antidote. Several are hidden around this house. One is inside the safe in front of you. You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind. The clues of their order can be found... Shit. Hey, wait a minute. Where you going? I\\'m gonna find an antidote, and I\\'m gonna get out of here. What? Antidote? You been in the joint. You talked to the guards that run the chambers. You know there ain\\'t no antidote for this shit. Look at this. The doors are locked. Hear that? It\\'s wood. Plus, dog, it\\'s not a fortress, it\\'s a fucking house. All I\\'m saying is let\\'s just take our time... and come up with a game plan. Well, you come up with a game plan. All right? I\\'m gettin\\' out of here. Look. - You OK? - Yeah, I\\'m fine. I wouldn\\'t do that if I was you. You don\\'t know what\\'s behind that fuckin\\' door. Fuck. Shit. Clear the room. OK. Let\\'s talk. Sit down, Eric. I want to play a game. The rules are simple. All you have to do is sit here and talk to me... listen to me. If you do that long enough... then you will find your son in a safe and secure state. We haven\\'t been properly introduced. My name\\'s John. I thought you liked to be called Jigsaw. No. It was the police and the press who coined the nickname Jigsaw. I never encouraged or claimed that. The Jigsaw piece I cut from my subjects... was only ever meant to be a symbol... that that subject was missing something... a vital piece of the human puzzle... the survival instinct. This is all really, really interesting, John. But right now I\\'d really like for you to talk to me... I <i>am</i> talking to you. You\\'re not listening. - Don\\'t forget the rules. - I\\'m listening to you. But all I\\'m hearing is the same sick fucking bullshit... that comes about two seconds into every interview... I\\'ve ever done with one of you fuckin\\' people. Well, that\\'s an interesting approach to police work, isn\\'t it? Aren\\'t you supposed to be convincing me that I\\'m your friend... lulling me into a false sense of security... so that I\\'ll confide in you? It\\'s a little hard to follow the manual... when you\\'ve got my son, John. The manual? What do you really want to do to me right now? What would you have done five years ago? Would you have followed the manual then? Would you have broken my jaw with a flashlight? You seem to know a whole lot about me. I know you were once considered a fearless police officer. Do you feel a whole lot safer now that you only sit behind a desk? I feel a whole lot of things right now. But you feel alive, that\\'s what you feel. And that\\'s the point. Would you... kindly... get me a glass of water? I would very much appreciate that. Fuck! Well, we\\'ve established that the macho bullshit approach... isn\\'t opening the door. - Any other suggestions? - Look who\\'s talking. The only door you know how to open is between your legs. Why don\\'t you shut the hell up?! - Why don\\'t <i>you</i> shut the hell up? - I\\'m sick of your bullshit! Hey, hey, hey! Back the fuck up! Back up! OK, man. All right. Nobody takes shit from nobody, we\\'ve established that. - Did you find anything? - No. Nothing. So, that ink on your arm... that\\'s Joliet, right? Yeah. So? - I did a stretch there myself. - Proud of you. And you, what is your correctional facility of choice? What\\'s your point? My point is, you didn\\'t get that way by teaching grade school, right? That makes three of us that\\'s done time. I think we should be concentrating on that tape... \\'cause that tape said we have more in common than we know. I say the three of us doing stretches... Hey! I found a door over here. I need the flashlight. Over there. What the fuck? Oh, shit. Hey! - Damn, kid. - Sorry. \"Obi.\" What the fuck is a Obi? <i>Ah-bi.</i> It\\'s my name. Hello, Obi. I want to play a game. For years you have burned those around you... with your lies, cons, and deceits. Now you\\'ll have a chance to redeem yourself... for the games you played with others... by playing one of mine. Inside the device in front of you are two antidotes... for the poison coursing through your veins. One is my gift to you for helping me kidnap the others. The second is yours to donate. However, one of them will come with a price. Remember, Obi... once you are in hell... only the devil can help you out. Wait a minute. What does that mean, \"kidnap the others\"? - How would I know? - Because you put us here. The car. It was... I knew I knew him. You\\'re the last person I saw before I woke up here. You did this. Are you sure it\\'s him? You better be sure. I\\'m sure. You would have done the same. I did what I had to do. I\\'ll give you a choice. You got five seconds to get us out of here. I don\\'t know the way out. Bullshit! You put us in here, you can get us out of here! No, I can\\'t. - Then you\\'re a dead man. - So are you. It\\'s not gonna... wait, wait, wait, wait. Listen to me. We got two antidotes at the back of that oven. - We\\'re wasting time here. - Wasting time? Are you kidding me?! He kidnapped me in the middle of the night. We don\\'t even know what\\'s in those syringes. You willing to stick yourself in the arm to find out? Yeah. OK, wait. So who gets them? I mean, there\\'s two... so which two people get the antidote? We\\'ll work that out later! Right now you goin\\' in there... or I\\'ll kill you where you stand. Shit. If you\\'re gonna threaten me with a knife... you may as well cut me a little. I guess I\\'m going in there to get those needles. But I get one. One for me. Hurry up. Come on, baby. You guys can fight over this one. Thank you, Obi. Come on. Oh, shit. The fuckin\\' door closed. Open the door! Open the door! It\\'s locked! I can\\'t open it! Open the door! Open the fuckin\\' door! Not funny! Come on! Get him out of there! The door! The nail! I can\\'t get it open! - Get him out of there! - Not funny! Use your coat! Use your fucking coat! Come on! He\\'s burnin\\' up! Stop it! - Come on! - Turn! Stop it! - Got to put your weight on it! - Stop it. Guys, there\\'s a window over here. - He\\'s got the antidote. - Stop it! - It\\'s glass or something. - Hang on, man. We\\'re gonna get you out. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Get out of the fuckin\\' way! Move! Move! Shit! Come on! The needles! He\\'s got the fuckin\\' needles! It\\'s fuckin\\' in there! I want the fuckin\\' needles! - I want the fuckin\\' needles! - Calm down! - Fuck! - Needles are fuckin\\' melted. They\\'re gone. He had a choice. Another one down, Kerry. How much more time are we gonna waste on this bastard? We\\'re not wasting time. We are doing exactly what we should be. Not what it looks like to me. You see, detective, Darwin\\'s theory of evolution... and survival of the fittest... based on his little trip to the Galapagos... no longer applies on this planet. We have a human race that doesn\\'t have the edge... or the will to survive. What the fuck do you want?! It\\'s hard to remain calm, isn\\'t it... when your son is walking around on those monitors. I can\\'t give you what you want... if you don\\'t tell me what the fuck it is. I told you what it is. Just remember the rules. No, you said you wanted to talk. Then you said you wanted to play a game. You\\'re talking, but it means nothing! What do you think the cure for cancer is, Eric? What? The cure for cancer. What is it? I don\\'t know what it is. But I know it\\'s not killing and torturing people... for your own sick fucking pleasure. I\\'ve never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them. Yeah, well, putting a gun to someone\\'s head... and forcing them to pull the trigger is still murder. Since when is force a problem for you? Why are you so desperate to get your son back? \\'Cause he\\'s my son. What\\'s the last thing you said to him before you left him? Well, then go! Seems to me that the knowledge of your son\\'s impending death... is causing you to act. Why is that we\\'re only willing to do that... when a life is at stake? I\\'ve always loved my son. That\\'s never changed. No, no. It\\'s changed now. You see, the knowledge of death changes everything. If I were to tell you the exact date and time of your own death... it would shatter your world completely. I know. Can you imagine what it feels like... to have someone sit you down... John Kramer? ...and tell you that you\\'re dying? The gravity of that, hmm? That the clock\\'s ticking for you. In a split second, your world is cracked open. You look at things differently, you smell things differently. You savor everything, be it a glass of water... or a walk in the park. The clock is ticking, John. But most people have the luxury of not knowing... when that clock\\'s gonna go off. And the irony of it is that that keeps them... from really living their life. It keeps them drinking that glass of water... but never really tasting it. You can still fix this, John. Yeah, but can we fix you? Me? I\\'m not fixable. I\\'ve got cancer. You\\'re using cancer as an excuse for what you do? No. The cancer isn\\'t what started me in my work. It was the moment that I decided to end my life... that started me in my work... and brought meaning to it. I had literally driven myself to suicide... and I had failed. My body had not been strong enough to repel cancer cells... yet I had lived through a plunge off a cliff. But to my amazement, I was alive. And I was determined to spend the rest of my days... testing the fabric of human nature. Do you understand, Eric? You got a chance to do something. Do it right now, John. Just tell me where my son is. - I\\'ll help you. - I don\\'t need your help... and I can tell you still don\\'t understand. Those that don\\'t appreciate life do not deserve life. My son appreciates his life. But do you appreciate yours? Do you appreciate your son\\'s? Oh, what is this shit?! Don\\'t forget the rules... if you want to find your son. Where are you? No. No, we don\\'t have 15 minutes. We need that location to the video feed. Hey. I don\\'t think we should stop, OK? Hello? Can you hear me? It\\'s the second time I\\'ve had to wake up... in this shit hole. You think you can stand up? Yeah. But I don\\'t really want to. There\\'s so much left to do. So many people left to talk to. This can\\'t be it. It\\'s not. Amanda, you said you survived this, right? I what? This guy... whoever\\'s doing it... you said that you\\'ve played before, and you survived. Yeah. So that means we could survive. Yeah. Amanda, why did he pick you? Because I was a fuckin\\' junkie. And the funny thing is... I passed the little test. If you passed his test, then why are you back here? I wasn\\'t being very good to myself. How long have you... I started in jail. - What were you arrested for? - Possession. But, I thought you said that... Maybe you should talk to the cop who arrested me. I\\'m guessing you\\'ve never been arrested before. No. I mean, I\\'ve been in trouble a few times, you know? In and out of stuff. My dad\\'s a... He\\'s a real hard-ass. He\\'s probably got half the city right now looking for me... just so he can kick my ass for disappearing on him. Yeah. Probably. We found a door. Come on. Come on. We have to go. It\\'s the only one without a lock... but we can\\'t get it open. - How\\'s it going? - It\\'s stuck on something. Oh, shit. Here, let me try. Move, move! - Come on. - Take it easy. Jeez! Back up, all right? If it\\'s stuck, it\\'s a trap. Lady, this whole house is a trap. Obviously someone didn\\'t want us to get in this room. - Now what? - I\\'m gonna be right back, OK? Whatever we do, we got three minutes to get it done. Hello, Xavier. I want to play a game. The game I want to play is very similar... to the one that you\\'ve been playing as a drug dealer. A game of offering hope to the desperate... for a price. I think we can agree that your situation is desperate... so I offer you hope. The price you pay... is that you must crawl into the same pit of squalor... your force your customers into. By entering this room, a timer has been started. When the timer expires... the door in front of you will be locked forever. - Guys... guys. - What? ...before the timer runs out. Can you unlock it... and retrieve the antidote inside? I will give you just one hint as to where that key is It will be like finding a needle in a haystack. Let the game begin. Somebody\\'s going in there. Somebody is fuckin\\' going in there, man. No! No! No! - Oh, shit. - What did you do? What have you done? No! No! No! No! No! No! Shit! My God. Come on! We don\\'t have time! Oh, shit. What the fuck\\'s wrong with you? What are you doing? - You\\'re out of your fuckin\\' mind. - Hurry up. Oh, shit! Come on! We don\\'t have time. Keep fuckin\\' looking. - Come on! Come on! - Fuck you! Oh, God! Someone\\'s gotta help her. What the fuck, guys?! No. No. No. No. No. God, no! Come on. No! No! No! Fuckin\\' bitch! All right. That\\'s enough. That\\'s not nearly enough, man. Stop this bullshit! Did you hear that tape? He knows about us. Our names. There is something that we\\'re not seeing. Jail. You said you three had been there. Make it four. For what? Doesn\\'t matter. Anybody else want to own up? What about you? You got juvie written all over you. No, never been. All right. Let\\'s talk this out. No. No more talking. The only thing you people have in common... is holding me back. I\\'m gone. Where is this goddamn tech team? They\\'ll be here any second. I\\'m not listening to this anymore. Another second is too fuckin\\' long. Look, I know how this guy works, OK? He\\'s playing a game. Eric just needs to stay in it a little bit longer. Take a look at the clock. You need to start thinking outside the box... or his son is gonna end up in one. His work. You want to get to him, that\\'s how you do it. He\\'s relishing this. It\\'s an opportunity to be heard, to be studied. Threaten to destroy his work. How will you get your conviction without all this evidence, Eric? I don\\'t need this shit to convict you. So go ahead. Destroy it. - I will. - Destroy it all. Just know it will not save your son if you do. You kill my son, I kill you. Go ahead. Why wait? We both know the sort of person you are. - Sir... - Get out of here. The sort of person who guns down an unarmed suspect. In fact, the sort of person who plants evidence... in order to obtain a conviction. The sort of person whose wife leaves him... - and whose son hates him. - Shut the fuck up! He set up all the traces to the satellite. Let\\'s go. Your tech team\\'s arrived. Just in time. You better hope they find the source of that feed. There\\'s something I haven\\'t told you, Eric. - I\\'m done listening to you. - Maybe I can just show it to you. But unfortunately, it\\'s going to be difficult for me to get it myself... so perhaps you could ask the people... who are listening on that walkie in there... if they could get it for me, all right? Brown desk. Second drawer down. You might not remember all those people... but I\\'m sure they remember you. You were the arresting officer in all their cases... and you were the one who planted all the evidence... used to obtain their convictions. You were the one who put them away. Your son is playing a game with a lot of people... who don\\'t like you very much, detective. It would be a shame if they discovered who he was. You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind. The clues of their order can be found over the rainbow. Son of a bitch. What are you doing? I haven\\'t decided yet. You know, the others... they\\'re scared of you. Good. You and me... we can keep going at each other like we\\'re back in the yard... or we can come together and figure out who\\'s doing this to us. You and the others can do what you want. I already found what I\\'m looking for. You remind me of me. No matter what kind of fucked up situation you\\'re in... you always gotta find yourself an enemy. You know what? I got enemies, man. Outside these fuckin\\' walls, bro. And they\\'re looking for me. And if they don\\'t find me... they going after the ones closest to me. My family. You understand? No. I don\\'t understand. It\\'s just me... and that\\'s the way I like it. Now, turn around. What? Turn around. Oh, shit. No. We can\\'t stop. Shit. Oh, my God. We\\'ve been here for two hours. If what that tape says is true... then in one hour, the front door will open. - We\\'re not gonna make it that long. - That\\'s a real winning attitude. She knows what she\\'s talking about. Oh, yeah? \"X\" marks the spot. What? \"X\" marks... marks the spot. There\\'s the answer. What are you doing with him? This is your father? - What, you know him? - Yeah. He\\'s the guy who put me away. He set me up. Tell me that\\'s not your father. Fuck. It\\'s OK. It\\'s OK. I can\\'t trust any of you. You two are on your own. Now we know what we have in common. Amanda, please. I didn\\'t know. Hey, kid, Amanda! Where are you? Please don\\'t leave me. We gotta move. Hey, kid. Amanda! I found a way out. Eight. Hey, kid! Do... not... run. Eric! Eric! No! Stop! Get your hands off of me! We tried it your way. You motherfucker, where is he? Eric. Damn it. Not a lot to go now until your son is pissing blood. Now, that\\'s the Eric Mathews they gave medals to. Help! Help me! Oh, my God. Jonas. Help me! Help me! Help! Please. It\\'s OK. - Help me. - It\\'s OK. No! Fucker! No! Amanda. Nobody\\'s listening anymore, asshole. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Come on. There you go. You gonna tell me where he is now? What? Say it again. Game... game over. I\\'ll take you to the house. You\\'re gonna take me right now. Right now. I will only take you. No one else. All right. Me and you. How do we get out of here? There\\'s a button on the wall. You better hurry. There\\'s not much time left. - The elevator! Open it! - Come on! - Pull it down! - Fuck! Secure the warehouse now! All right. Let\\'s go! - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Damn it. We\\'ve got a lock. This is Kerry. They\\'re both gone. If I don\\'t find my son, I swear to God... Kerry, they\\'re gone. Fucking gone. Yes! Kerry. We got a lock. We got a lock on the house. - Rigg, we got it. - What?! 237 North Hyde Crescent. 237 North Hyde Crescent. Got it. Where to now? Straight ahead. Come on, come on. Where are you? Make a right on Alfred. Come on, let\\'s go! Open the fucking door! Open the door! There\\'s nowhere to go! All I want is the number on the back of your head! There\\'s nowhere to go! Come on, Amanda! I can\\'t hold it. Come on, let me in! Let me in! Open the door! Come on! What do we do? Take a left at the next street. It\\'s the last house on the left. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Come on! Come on, Amanda! - Man, what is it? - It\\'s a door. It\\'s a fucking door. You have nowhere to go! You have nowhere to go! Come on! Help me move this thing. I\\'m not gonna hurt you! Come on, Amanda! - Shit, it\\'s locked! - Let me in! Come on. Open this door! Come on! The key. The one we found with the tape recorder. Where is it? Where is it? Fuck! Jonas. Jonas had it last. Come on, Amanda! Find it! Hurry! Come on! Come on! Open this door! Let me in! Eric, you\\'re gonna need this key... when you get inside the house. No! Where the hell are we? Run! Run! Daniel? Daniel! Daniel, we\\'ve got to go! We\\'ve got to go! Run. - All right, come on. - Let\\'s go, let\\'s go. Go, go, go! - Hallway\\'s clear. - We\\'re in. Daniel! Ground floor secure. Moving out. Moving out. Kerry, we\\'re in the house. I repeat... we\\'re in the house. I cannot see you, sergeant. Repeat... cannot see you. Repeat... I cannot see you. - Where the hell is everybody? - What is your 20? Rigg, do you copy? Hello, Mr. Hindle. Follow your heart. I wish I would\\'ve checked in there first. What the fuck is this? My name is \"Very fucking confused!\" What\\'s your name? I\\'m gonna kill your husband now. He doesn\\'t want us to cut through our chains. What are you doing? No! He wants us to cut through our feet. Oh, my God! Daniel! Oh, no. Please. He\\'s gone. It doesn\\'t matter. All I want is the number on the back of his neck. And then yours. You still don\\'t know your own number. How are you gonna get it if I don\\'t tell you? Daniel! Fuck. Daniel? I still cannot see you, sergeant. Rigg, do you copy? - Left side clear. - Right side clear. All clear. I still can\\'t see you, sergeant. I repeat... cannot see you. It\\'s not live. Kerry, we\\'re in the wrong fucking house! They\\'ve been dead this whole fucking time. - Get your team out of there. - Let\\'s go. Daniel? Daniel? Daniel? Daniel. Daniel. Hello, Eric. You probably don\\'t even remember me... but you changed my life once. You sent me to prison. I was guilty of a lot of things... but not the drug charge you framed me for. You wouldn\\'t know the things you lose... when you\\'re locked away. The second time somebody changed my life... I <i>was</i> guilty. Hello, Amanda. But my life was saved that day. - You said you survived this, right? - Yeah. I found myself a father... a leader... a teacher. You must meet death... in order to be reborn. He helped me. What is the cure for cancer, Eric? Those that don\\'t appreciate life do not deserve life. The cure for death itself. The answer is immortality. Daniel! By creating a legacy... by living a life worth remembering... you become immortal. So now we find the tables are turned. He asked for you. - What the fuck do you want? - I told you. - He wants us to survive this. - I want to play a game. You have to play by the fucking rules! The rules are simple. All you have to do... - is sit here and talk to me. - What? If you can do that long enough... you will find your son in a safe and secure state. What the fuck is that? It\\'s your son Daniel. You remember him, don\\'t you? My dad\\'s a real hard-ass. I call you unworthy of the life you\\'ve been given. The knowledge of your son\\'s impending death... has caused you to forgive all his sins. Why is it that we\\'re only willing to do that... - when a life is at stake? - Daniel! - I\\'m not listening to you. - Don\\'t forget the rules. Shut the fuck up! - He\\'s playing a game. - I don\\'t want to talk to him. You\\'re not saying shit. We both know the sort of person you are. Not long to go now until your son is pissing... I\\'ll take you to the house. Daniel? Something I haven\\'t told you, Eric. It is I who will carry on John\\'s work after he dies. Daniel! So go ahead. Destroy it. - And you... - Daniel! are my first test subject. Now you are locked away... helpless and alone. Fucking bitch. Game over. I\\'ll fucking kill you! You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! I\\'ll fucking kill you! No! Subtitles by LeapinLar Support us and become VIP member ', ['riddle', 'serial killer']), ('HAPPINESS IS NOT ALWAYS FUN FEAR EATS THE SOUL Yes? Excuse me, but it\\'s raining so hard outside. And I thought, \"Emmi, better get inside that bar.\" I pass by here every evening and hear that foreign music. What language are they singing in? Arabic. Arabic. I see. We have German stuff in the jukebox, too. Nearly half. But of course they prefer the stuff from back home. Of course. What would you like to drink? What do people usually have? All sorts of things. Whatever you like. Cola or beer. That sounds good, thanks. What then? Beer or cola? A cola, please. She\\'s nuts. Talks a blue streak. Maybe she never gets a chance to talk otherwise. Probably. - Well, are you coming or not? - No. - And why not? - Cock broken. Forget it, then! - Another beer? - Sure. Two beers. How much? - For nine beers? - Yes, nine beers. Ten marks, 80. - Keep the change. - Thanks. Why don\\'t you dance with the old girl? Me dance with old woman? Why not? Your legs aren\\'t broken, are they? What\\'s up? She says I should dance with old woman. - You dance with me? - What? Dance? Yes. You sit alone. Sad. Not good sitting alone. Why not? It must be all of 20 years since I last danced. Maybe I can\\'t anymore. Don\\'t matter. Dance very slow. Turn the lights off. Where are you from? Little town in Morocco - Tismit. Oh, Morocco. Yes. Very nice, but no work. You speak German well. Been here long? Two years. Much work. Me, too. Half of life consists of work. You have no man? Married? My husband died ages ago. What do you do? Work on cars. All day, all time. And you spend your evenings here? Yes. Good music, Arab buddies. Don\\'t know other places. Germans with Arabs not good. Why? Don\\'t know. Germans not same people as Arabs. - But at work surely... - Not the same. German master. Arab dog. - But that... - Who cares? Better not think too much. Think much, cry much. - Here. - Thanks. - Like another drink? - No, thanks. I have to get up early. I\\'d like to pay for the cola. - One mark. - Me pay cola. Here. Thanks a lot, but... You talk good with Ali. Ali pay cola. - Your name\\'s Ali? - Not Ali, but everyone says Ali. Now I am Ali. - What\\'s your real name? El Hedi ben Salem M\\'Barek Mohammed Mustapha. - That\\'s pretty long. - Yes. In Tismit all names long. I\\'m afraid I have to go now. Good-bye. - Not good-bye. I go home with you to door. Not going alone, better. If you like. This awful rain. Here we are. - This your house? - Yes. You can wait here a minute. Maybe the rain will stop. Otherwise you\\'ll catch cold, and it\\'ll be my fault. What work you do? Well, you know... Yes? I don\\'t like to say. People always give you such a funny look. Me not look funny. No, not you. Well, I clean. I\\'m a cleaning lady. In big company? Not too big, but there\\'s a lot of glass. It\\'s hard work. There are four of us to clean eight floors. We do two each, one in the morning and one in the evening. In between, I\\'m free to do private jobs. They\\'re always looking for cleaners nowadays. I never learned a proper trade. You wouldn\\'t believe some of the things that happen. One employer sends for me in his Mercedes. With a chauffeur. Who am I to refuse? He has a factory or something. You should wear lighter-colored suits, Ali. They\\'d look better on you. Me? Light suits? Why? It\\'s none of my business, but dark clothes look so sad, don\\'t they? Don\\'t know. Maybe. It\\'s good to talk with someone. I\\'m alone most of the time. All the time, really. My children have their own lives. You have many children? Three. Two sons and a daughter. They\\'re all married. Where? Other town? No, here. But they live their own lives. We get together on special occasions, but... With us in Morocco, family always together. Mama never alone. Mama alone, not good. Other countries have other customs. I\\'ll go see if the rain\\'s stopped. It\\'s still pouring. Maybe... - Yes? Why don\\'t you come up for a while? I\\'ll make us a coffee, and maybe the rain will stop. - I\\'d like to, but... - People always say \"but.\" And nothing ever changes. Come on up! I\\'ve got a bottle of brandy. A Christmas present from my oldest son. You like brandy? - Brandy? Yes. There you are. It\\'s no fun drinking alone. Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski. I wanted to give you the three marks, 50 that I owe you. There. And thanks a lot. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Come on up. - Mrs. Karges? - Imagine! Mrs. Kurowski\\'s got a foreigner up there. What? - A black man. - Real black? Well, not that black, but pretty dark. She\\'s not really German herself. With a name like Kurowski! What are things coming to? I wonder what she\\'s up to with him. No idea. Maybe she\\'s buying a carpet. At 9:30 at night? Who knows? Good night, Mrs. Karges. - Good night. Very good coffee. My family says Emmi\\'s coffee is enough to wake the dead. Would you like some brandy with it? Please. My husband was Polish, not German. He was a foreign worker during the war. He just stayed on afterwards. My parents were still alive then. They said, \"Emmi, this\\'ll come to no good.\" That\\'s because he was a foreigner, you see? Cheers. - Cheers. My father hated all foreigners. He was a party member, Hitler\\'s party. You know who Hitler was? - Hitler? Yes. I was in the party, too. Everyone was, or almost everyone. But Frantizek and I got along fine. That was my husband\\'s name. But then he started having liver trouble. He always drank too much. But he was always a lot of fun. He died in 1955. Oh, well. Another drink? - Yes. - And you? Are you married? - Not married. And your parents? - Parents dead. - Both of them? Papa very old. Mama very sick. Any brothers or sisters? - No brother. Five sisters. - Five? Five sisters. Ali smallest. All sisters older. And they\\'re all still in Morocco? Not just Morocco. Algeria, Tunisia. Papa go walking with camels. Papa Berber. Berber walk all over Africa. Ali must go now. Very late. Have another drink. Just ten more minutes. Last tram now. Tram go, Ali walk home. - Where do you live? - Very far. Hofmann Strasse. Do you have a room there? Yes, with five friends from work. Six in small room. Six men in one small room? Three beds here, three beds there. - Kif-kif. - What\\'s kif-kif? \"Who cares\" in Arabic. That\\'s funny. But six men in one room, that\\'s inhuman. Arabs not human in Germany. Different earlier. But since catastrophe in Munich, not good. You know what? Have another drink, and I\\'ll fix you up a bed. You can sleep here tonight. - Ali sleep here? Because you have such a long way, and there are six in a room, and because you\\'re nice. - You nice. Very nice. - Thanks. When do you start work? At 6:30. Good. Me too. We can have breakfast together. I\\'ll get your bed ready. Have another drink. The bathroom\\'s down the hall. I must have a spare toothbrush. I bought a ten-pack once. There. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Good night. - Good night. I\\'ve laid out one of my husband\\'s pajamas for you. - Sleep well. - Thanks. What\\'s the matter? Ali no sleep. Much thinking in head. Wants to talk with you. Okay? All right. Sit down here. Ali much alone, too. Always working, drinking. Nothing else. Maybe German right. Arab not human. Nonsense. You mustn\\'t even think that. You said yourself, thinking makes a person sad. Though it\\'s not really true that thinking makes you sad. Of course not. What else should we do with our time? All the years, all the months. And suddenly it\\'s over, and what is there to show for it? My God, I - Good morning. Your coffee always good. I\\'m actually quite a cook. You must come for dinner sometime. I\\'m sure you\\'d like it. - Sure. - Maybe... - Yes? Oh, nothing. It\\'s just that an old woman like me... You not old woman. You good. Big heart. Really? My God. Don\\'t cry. Please. Why cry? Because I\\'m so happy and so full of fear, too. Not fear. Fear not good. Fear eat soul. Fear eats the soul? That\\'s nice. Is that an Arab saying? - Yes. All Arabs speak so. It\\'s late. Must go now. If I come late, not good. When boss mad with Ali, real mean. I must go, too. I\\'ll get dressed, and we\\'ll go down together. I\\'m taking the subway. You too? No, I take tram. - Well, then. Good-bye. - Good-bye. Today a man chatted me up in the subway. Me! An old woman! A foreign worker. He wanted to buy me a coffee. - They stop at nothing. - But... No, nothing\\'s sacred to them, not even old age. They\\'re filthy pigs. The way they live! Whole families crammed into one room. All they\\'re interested in is money. Maybe they can\\'t find a decent place. No. They\\'re stingy. Stingy, unwashed pigs. And they have only one thing in their heads: women. But they do their work. That\\'s what they\\'re here for. Hogwash. Go down to the station and look around. A load of trash! None of them work. Exactly. They live here at our expense. You only have to read the papers, full of rapes and so on. But some of them are married to German women, aren\\'t they? Some women would stoop to anything. I\\'d die of shame. The mere thought! I\\'ve always said, women like that are filthy whores. There\\'s one where I live. She must be 50 at least. She\\'s got one. A Turk, I think. He\\'s much younger than she is. But no one talks with her anymore. Serves her right. Maybe he talks with her, and she doesn\\'t need anyone else. Nobody can live without others. No one, Emmi. And what can you talk about with someone like that? Most of them don\\'t speak a word of German. All they want is sex. They\\'re not interested in talking. Some women want it that way. Uncivilized. Sex on the brain. I\\'d die of shame if I were like that. Well, we\\'d better get back to work. - Get me a beer. - Get it yourself. If I have to get up, you\\'re going to get it good. You wouldn\\'t have the energy. You\\'ll see. I have to go back to work on Friday. - At last. - It\\'s easy for you to laugh. I\\'m not laughing. I just want my peace during the day. Because I don\\'t leave you alone? It depends how you look at it. Who\\'s that? How could I know in here who\\'s ringing out there? Then you\\'d better go look. Lazy swine. - Mom! - Christ Almighty! - Guess who\\'s here. - I heard. Be nice to her, Eugen. Come in, Mom. Hello. Hi. Eugen\\'s on sick leave till the day after tomorrow. - You\\'re sick? - Sort of. - Shall I make you a coffee? - Yes. That would be nice. - What\\'ve you got? - A fever and a cough. Bull. He\\'s just lazy. The hell I am! I had a cough and fever, but I feel better now. Aren\\'t you working for your manager today? No, that\\'s tomorrow. - And otherwise? - Not too bad. Oh, well. Your coffee. Want one, too? - Leave me alone. Mind your manners while Mom is here. I\\'ll do what I like in my own home. It\\'s my home, too. Shut your trap and put some clothes on you, you slut! Just look at you. It\\'s like this every day, Mom. Are there any foreign workers where you work? Don\\'t mention foreign workers. It makes him see red. - Why? - Because they\\'re swine. Oh, I see. Yes, they are! He\\'s even got a Turkish foreman. He just can\\'t get over it. Can\\'t get over it? I ignore the guy completely. - And when he gives you orders? - He doesn\\'t give me orders. - Sure he does. - Then... Get me the cigarettes. - I wouldn\\'t dream of it. - Krista! Yes? Leave it, Mom. I\\'ll get up. I\\'ll get them myself. - I\\'ve fallen in love. - What? Yes, Krista. I\\'m in love with a Moroccan who\\'s 20 years younger than me, probably more. You\\'ve got a strange sense of humor, Mom. It\\'s no joke. It\\'s true. I\\'m in love with a Moroccan who\\'s younger than me. Much younger. I felt it was my duty to tell you. Don\\'t bother. I\\'ll see myself out. Bye. Bye, Mom. You know what? No, but I\\'m sure you\\'ll tell me. Your mother\\'s got a screw loose. A cola. Good evening. Strange, it\\'s not even raining today. No, it\\'s not raining. It\\'s really quite nice. I\\'ll pay right away. - One mark. - Here you are. - By the way, this is my bar. Yes, okay. And? Good evening. Yes? Yes. Well, then... - Like it? - Tastes good. Dig in. There\\'s plenty. Thanks, not too much. - Would you like coffee? - Yes, coffee. - Ali bring money. - No. Why no? Ali eat and drink. Always you pay. Not right. But I like to. I earn enough. And money spoils a friendship. Not spoil friendship. You take money. Everything good. I\\'ll keep it for you in the drawer. When you need it, just take it. That money not for Ali. For Emmi. I don\\'t want it. it\\'s your money. I don\\'t want a penny from you. You make me so happy. Good evening, Mr. Gruber. Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski. Good evening. This is Mr. Gruber, the landlord\\'s son. Please have a seat. - Thanks. - Like a brandy? - Yes, please. But I have something serious to talk about with you. Well, then... I can only think you haven\\'t read your lease properly. Of course I\\'ve read it. Then you must know you\\'re not allowed to sublet. Section five, clause two. You mean, because of Ali? Yes, Mrs. Kurowski. I - Cheers. That\\'s good. All I can say is your lodger must move out. By tomorrow, Mrs. Kurowski. But Ali\\'s not a lodger. We\\'re going to get married. Well... that\\'s different. I\\'ll be on my way, then. You\\'re old enough to know what you\\'re doing. Good night. Good grief! What have I done? What he say? He said you can\\'t stay here. Not good man. He\\'s like everyone else. No better, no worse. I told him we were going to marry. We marry? You and me? Okay. Good idea. But I didn\\'t mean it. I just said it because - You and me marry, very good. Now drink. Cheers. For everything good. Yes, Ali. Good for everything. Now we go tell Arab buddies. And they were so huge, with big sleeves and trousers. And this little man came along and just vanished in the suit. We laughed our heads off. Cheers. The filthy old whore. You\\'re just jealous. Jealous? Of her? Now I\\'ll play our song. Come on. Let\\'s dance. It\\'ll never work out. It\\'s unnatural, plain unnatural. That\\'s what I say. Of course it won\\'t work. So what? CML REGISTRY II, MUNICH You know what my name is now? - Long name. - A very long name. Emanuela ben Salem M\\'Barek Mohammed Mustapha. Sounds terrific, doesn\\'t it? - Very nice. Nice? I don\\'t know. Yes, nice. If you say so. Come on. Hello, Krista. This is Mom. I\\'d like to invite you over. Albert and Bruno, too. Next Saturday. Why? No special reason. I have something I want to discuss with you. Call that taxi. This is where Hitler used to eat, from 1929 to \\'33. I\\'ve always wanted to come here. Hitler, you know? - Hitler, yes. Let\\'s just order the most expensive things on the menu. The best soups, the best appetizers. Or do you want something special? I eat what you eat. Good heavens! Look at that! Caviar costs 45 marks. Still, today\\'s a special day. Did you know that there\\'s golden caviar, too? I read it in a magazine. - Golden caviar? - Yes, like real gold. But it goes to the Shah of Persia. Ordinary people can\\'t get it. Caviar\\'s good for love, they say. Good for love? Yes, it puts you in the mood. But I don\\'t believe that. Or only a bit. So, I\\'ll order now. Waiter. - Have you decided? - Yes. We\\'ve decided. Two lobster cream soups, caviar for two and... Chateaubriand for two. How would you like the Chateaubriand? How? Grilled, I thought. Of course, ma\\'am. Rare or medium? Rare, that sounds good. Rare, then. Almost raw. Good. Raw? Actually... if it\\'s raw, we\\'d rather - What was the other one called? Medium. Right. That\\'s not raw? No, it\\'s medium. That\\'ll be fine. An aperitif to start with? An - Oh, of course! What kind? Maybe... What would you recommend? You\\'d enjoy our house aperitif. Well, if you say so, fine. He really had me on the rack there. If you\\'re not used to things like that... Well, what\\'s up? Why did you ask us over? You have to know sooner or later. Are you ill, Mom? Why ill? Because this is all so official. I\\'m anything but ill, Albert. I\\'ve gotten married. You\\'ve gotten - Mom! But - Who? Who did you marry? Come on in. This is my husband. El Hedi ben Salem M\\'Barek Mohammed Mustapha. I call him Ali. Leave him. Bruno! You shouldn\\'t have done that, Mother. Not that. It\\'s a disgrace. You can forget you have children. I want nothing to do with a whore. Come on, Eugen. We\\'re not staying in this pigsty. - What would we like? - A Libelle. Libelle. Not lemonade. Like butter. - Butter. - No, not butter. Like butter. Libelle. No, mister, not that. - Make up your mind. I don\\'t have all day. Well? Libelle, like butter. Not lemonade. Listen, you go and learn some German first. Then come back. - No understand. - You understand me all right. Learn German first, then come back. Good-bye. Don\\'t understand. I say Libelle, like butter. Not lemonade. Why you not understand? Why? What does he want? Libelle. Sure, that\\'s the new margarine. You think I don\\'t know that? He not give Libelle. Say he don\\'t understand. It\\'s written clearly on the list, \"Libelle.\" I say, \"Libelle, like butter.\" He give lemonade. He just doesn\\'t want to serve you. I\\'ll show him. - What you do? I\\'ll go over and have a word with him. I\\'ve been a customer of that swine for 20 years. No fight. Fighting not good. I won\\'t fight. Don\\'t worry. Hello. Hello, Mrs. Kurowski. What\\'ll it be? Tell me, Mr. Angermeyer, why won\\'t you serve my husband? What\\'s he done to you? Not serve your husband? He can\\'t tell me what he wants. He asked for Libelle. Margarine. You see, I didn\\'t understand. You understood him, all right. But you didn\\'t want to understand. And you know why? Because he\\'s a foreigner. That\\'s why you didn\\'t understand. I won\\'t let you accuse me of prejudice against foreigners. I have nothing against foreigners, not even yours. Serve him, then, when he comes in! I can\\'t serve someone who can\\'t speak German. Nonsense! He can speak German better than you. I\\'m not letting you tell me a black can speak better German than me. Not you! And that\\'s the last time I serve you, too. I don\\'t need trouble in my shop. Leave the shop at once or I\\'ll throw you out! You! - Yes? - Out! Mrs. Kurowski. We\\'ve been meaning to have a word with you. About cleaning the staircase. In all seriousness. We\\'ve spoken to everyone in the house, and they all agree. About what? About the dirt in the house lately. Dirt? I don\\'t see any. But everyone says there is. And we\\'ve all agreed you\\'ll have to clean twice a month. Me? Why? We\\'ve had our system for years. Yes, but the situation has changed radically. Radically. It\\'s the same everywhere. With people like that in the house, dirt takes over. You know what I say? You put your own house in order, and I\\'ll see to mine. I don\\'t meddle in your affairs. We have nothing to reproach ourselves with. If you ask me, you\\'re jealous, Mrs. Karges. You\\'re just jealous. Good day. The nerve! Me? Jealous? What does she mean by that? Hello. Here. - Thanks. That\\'s 236 marks, 50. Five hours overtime. One every day. And I thought you were boozing it up somewhere. No understand \"boozing.\" Drinking. Beer or liquor. Ali not drink without you. That\\'s all right. I earned 210 marks this week, and you 236.50. That makes 446 marks, 50 in all. We\\'ll be rich, Ali. And we\\'ll buy ourselves a little piece of heaven. Why heaven? Oh, just a fancy of mine. I take a shower. - Want a coffee? - Coffee? Yes. You\\'re very beautiful, Ali. Coffee\\'s ready. - Here. - Thanks. Paula. What brings you here? My sister died today. She\\'d been sick a long time. The funeral\\'s on Monday morning. I wanted to ask if you\\'d fill in for me. Come in, please. This is Mrs. Borchert. She works with me. Ali, my husband. Your - Yes, Paula. We\\'ve been married for three months. My God. Hello. Well, I\\'d better be going. - Have a coffee with us. - No, thanks. I\\'ll ask Hedwig about Monday. Who\\'d have dreamed that? But Paula - That woman no good. Nonsense. She\\'s okay. She was just surprised. That woman has death in her eye. No wonder. Her sister just died. No. Other death in her eye. You\\'re imagining things. Come on, get dressed. Let\\'s go see buddies. Germans not good. I don\\'t feel like going out today. Why don\\'t you bring your friends here for a drink? It\\'s much nicer here, isn\\'t it? Buddies come here? Yes. Get dressed and bring them here. - Hi. - Hello. Nobody\\'s here yet. Probably doing overtime. A beer? - Small beer. How are you? Good. Happy? Don\\'t know. - Come by my place again sometime. - Maybe. - I\\'ll make you some couscous. - Your couscous good. - Well, then? - Don\\'t know. Or are you scared of your wife? Ali not scared. - Well, come by then. - Maybe. - Hello. - Hi, Ali. - Come to my home? Little party. - Okay. I\\'m not going to that old whore\\'s place! She not old whore! All right. Let me go. Come on. Come to my place? Little party. Bastards. It\\'s on the next floor up. Can\\'t get a wink of sleep. She\\'s got four foreigners in her apartment. Four of them! You\\'re not safe anymore. Now, now. Let\\'s not exaggerate. She\\'s not, Officer. They\\'re all Arabs. You know what they\\'re like, bombs and all that. They\\'re not all like that, ma\\'am. Come on, Hans. We\\'ll have a look. Did you see that? Policemen with long hair. Things sure have changed. Five. One, two, three, four, five. Nothing. Again nothing. At last. It\\'s your turn. Cheers. Good evening. Sorry, but your neighbors say the music\\'s causing a disturbance. If you would turn it down, please. But - Sorry, but if it disturbs them... Okay, I\\'ll turn it down. Good night. Six. Turn the music down a little. Why? They\\'ve set the police on us. Could you hand me a knife? The subway rates are going up. It was in the paper today. Not again. I read it, too. Want a piece? Stop acting so strange. Hand me a knife, will you? And it said women should have a cancer test every six months. - Every six months? - Yes, every woman. Not that it does much good. My sister-in-law, for instance - Let\\'s sit over there. Anyway, I\\'m making an appointment for next week. Make one for us, too. You\\'ll come, won\\'t you, Frieda? Yes, if you\\'re going. I\\'d be scared alone. Hello. Hello, Mrs. Kurowski. That rabble. Can\\'t we do anything about it, Mr. Gruber? Why? They seem very happy together. What\\'s happiness? There\\'s still such a thing as decency. I fail to see anything indecent, hard as I might try. Good-bye. - Can you understand it? - No. Everyone\\'s looking. Don\\'t let it bother you. They\\'re just envious. No understand \"envious.\" Envious is when someone doesn\\'t like another person having something. Understand. They\\'re just envious. All of them. Why do you cry? Because I\\'m so happy on the one hand, and on the other, I can\\'t bear it anymore. All this hatred from everyone. Sometimes I wish I were all alone with you in the world with nobody around us. I always pretend I don\\'t care, but I do care. It\\'s killing me. Nobody looks me in the eye anymore. They all have such a horrible grin. They\\'re all swine! Dirty swine, all of them! Stop staring, you stupid swine! This is my husband. My husband. I love you, too. - Me more. - How much? So much. And me, from here to Morocco. You know what? Let\\'s go away somewhere. Somewhere where we\\'ll be on our own, where no one knows us and no one stares. When we get back, it\\'ll all be different. Everyone will be nice to us. They will. They\\'re back again. Who? Mrs. Kurowski and her foreigner. You know, I always thought she was nice. She is. But that foreigner... Things like that don\\'t last. You reckon? Of course. Listen. Next time she walks by, go out and say hello. To her? No! Anton. Don\\'t forget she was a good customer. You\\'re right there. Just walk out, say hello, and things will be back to normal. And she\\'ll do her shopping here again. Yes, they\\'re all going to the supermarket instead of coming here. You\\'re right, Adele. In business you have to hide your aversions. Mrs. Kurowski. Just the person... - Hello, Mrs. Ellis. - Hello. Imagine! They\\'ve sent my son to Norway for a whole year. I\\'ll be right up. So he asked me to keep his things here for him. But I\\'ve got such a small cellar, and I thought, since I have all that stuff down there, maybe you... Of course, Mrs. Ellis. I don\\'t need all that space. When would you need it? Today, if possible. His stuff\\'s been down there for 10 days now. It would be very nice if... Okay. I\\'ll tell my husband to give you a hand. I\\'m sure it\\'s not so light. It\\'s good to have a strong man in the house. He\\'ll be down in 10 minutes. Bye. Bye, Mrs. Kurowski. And thanks a million. Don\\'t mention it. Such a nice woman. And so helpful. Yes, she always was. Here are the cellar keys. Help the woman move her stuff. Be nice to her and she\\'ll be nice to us. I\\'m going shopping. Do you understand? - Understand. - And put something else on. Anton, here she comes. Out you go. Hello, Mrs. Kurowski. Back from your vacation? Was the weather nice? - Very nice. It\\'s high time we took a vacation. Where did you go? Not far. To Steinsee. I know it. Nice place. Come in and tell us all about it. Hello, Mr. Kurowski. Your mother\\'s back. She\\'s just gone shopping. She\\'ll be back in a minute. Thanks, Mrs. Karges. I\\'ll wait. Her husband\\'s down in the cellar helping Mrs. Ellis rearrange things. Her son\\'s suddenly been transferred to Norway. And your mother has the biggest cellar here. Mrs. Kurowski. Your son Bruno\\'s here. - You got the check? - Yes, just now. The letter was in the mailbox when I got back, with the check. It\\'s for the TV set. I\\'m sorry, but I was so surprised I just lost my head. I wouldn\\'t have reacted like that otherwise. You always were a hothead. Remember the cat? My God, Mom, you can\\'t hold that against me all my life. No. I had really forgotten all about it. Everything will be okay now. I\\'ve spoken to Krista. Albert still hasn\\'t gotten over it, but he\\'ll come around. Sure. Time heals all wounds. Actually, I wanted to ask you a favor. Out with it. No need to beat around the bush with your old mom. No, you\\'re right. - Brandy? - No, thanks. Hildegard wants to take a part-time job again. What with everything being so expensive... We\\'ve hunted high and low for a kindergarten, but it\\'s hopeless. They\\'re all booked up. So I thought maybe you could take Beate from 1:00 to 5:00. I\\'d pick her up afterwards. It would be a great help. Hello. I\\'m going to shower. Do you think you could manage it? Hildegard starts work at Pschorr on the first. Of course. I\\'ve always been there for you. Thanks a lot, Mom. Then I\\'ll be going. They\\'re waiting for me. I might come by on Sunday, with Hildegard. Bye, Mom. - Bye. Finished in the cellar? Finished. You no make couscous? I can\\'t make couscous, you know that. You should get used to the way things are done in Germany. People in Germany don\\'t eat couscous. Couscous good sometimes. I don\\'t like couscous. Where are you off to? Ali go to Arab buddies. Maybe eat couscous. You\\'re not taking me with you? No. Want to be alone. CLOSED TODAY Hello. Back in town? Come in. Have a nice vacation? - Very nice. - Like something to drink or to eat? - Couscous. Okay. I\\'ll put the pan on. There\\'s some fig brandy in the cupboard. Help yourself to a glass. This is Yolanda. - She\\'s from Yugoslavia. - Hezregovina. Interesting. Where\\'s Frieda? Haven\\'t you heard? She got fired without notice. Fired without notice? For stealing. No. It\\'s true. They say she\\'s been at it for ages. They caught her with an adding machine. The next day, she didn\\'t show up, and Yolanda came. Well, I never! Who would have thought it of Frieda? Of course, she never did look you straight in the eye. - Really? - You must remember. Always shifty. You\\'re probably right. And then... Let\\'s go over there. There was the matter of our raise. That\\'s right. Twenty pfennigs. Well? You can forget it. They\\'ve probably forgotten us. Forgotten? I can\\'t imagine that. There\\'s no other explanation. Come here. Listen. Yolanda gets 3.40 an hour, 50 pfennigs less than us. - No. - Yes. They know all the tricks up there. We must think of something to get that raise. Come to my place and we\\'ll talk it over, okay? - How about it? - We\\'ll see. What about her? There\\'s no point. She\\'s on a different pay scale. 6:00, then? - Okay. This is Ali. Say hello. Hello. He\\'s a handsome one, Emmi, and so clean. What do you mean? Sorry, but I always thought they didn\\'t wash. He does. He even takes a shower every day. And just look at those muscles! He\\'s really strong. Come here. Go ahead. Feel his muscles. Terrific! And such nice soft skin. He\\'s so young. But he\\'s a good man, really. What\\'s eating him? He has his moods. It\\'s his foreign mentality. Would you like something to drink? - Yes. Coffee, please. You too, Paula? - Yes, but not too strong. I\\'ll be right back. Oh, it\\'s you. Come in. But I\\'m on my way out. There\\'s still some couscous in the kitchen. You can warm it up and watch TV. Or do you want to come along? No. I stay here. Will you be here when I get back? See you later. Oh, I\\'m sorry. I thought... That\\'s all right, Mrs. Kurowski. Good night. - Are you going? - Don\\'t know. Stay here. I hate sleeping alone. I\\'ll just go wash quickly. Working nights really takes it out of me. There\\'s this guy at the movies. Suddenly there\\'s an awful stench. He asks the guy in front of him, \"Did you shit your pants?\" And the guy answers, \\'Yes. Why?\" A mouse and an elephant meet. The mouse says to the elephant, \"My, aren\\'t you big!\" And the elephant says to the mouse, \"My, aren\\'t you small!\" And the mouse replies, \"Well, I\\'ve been ill for six weeks.\" - There he is. - Yes, thanks. Where were you all night? I\\'ve been worried sick. You shouldn\\'t do this to me, Ali. You don\\'t have to say anything. Just come back. I need you, Ali. I need you so much. Who\\'s that, Ali? Your grandma from Morocco? What does she want? His grandma from Morocco! Ten marks. Another 10. Fifteen. Twenty. Go to my place and get 100 marks for me. Hurry. He get money, then I play more. Three whiskies. Don\\'t let them fleece you! You\\'re gambling away a week\\'s wages. Who care? Kif-kif! Understand? One. Two. Ten. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. A cola, miss. Shit! Thanks, and... Yes? Would you play the gypsy record for me, please? - \"The Black Gypsy\"? - Yes, that\\'s it. Thanks. You dance with me? Me sleep with other woman. That\\'s not important, Ali. Not important at all. I don\\'t want to, but always so nervous. You\\'re a free man. You can do what you like. I know how old I am. I see it in the mirror every day. I can\\'t keep you from doing things. But when we\\'re together, we must be nice to each other. Otherwise, life\\'s not worth living. I don\\'t want other woman. I love only you. I love you, too. Together we\\'re strong. Call an ambulance! Quick! Send an ambulance to the Asphalt Bar, 17 Cornelius Strasse. Someone has collapsed. He\\'s groaning terribly. Thanks. He has a perforated stomach ulcer. It happens a lot with foreign workers. It\\'s the stress. And there\\'s not much we can do. We\\'re not allowed to send them to convalesce. We can only operate. And six months later they have another ulcer. - And him? - Oh, he\\'ll recover. But he\\'ll be back here again in six months. No, he won\\'t. I\\'ll do everything in my power - Well, the best of luck anyway. And don\\'t stay too long. Good-bye.

Let\\'s go. Go faster! Faster! Sorry, gentlemen. This whole area is closed for weapons testing for the next 24 hours. That includes all on-base personnel. Good afternoon, sir. I\\'m afraid that goes for you, too, Colonel, sir. The Pentagon sent out revised... Russians. This ain\\'t gonna be easy. Not as easy as it used to be. - Well, we\\'ve been through worse. - Yeah? When? Flensburg. There was twice as many. - We were younger. - I still am young! We had guns. Put your hands down, will you? You\\'re embarrassing us. Bet you 500 bucks we can get out of this. Let\\'s call it 100. You recognize building, yes? Drop dead. I\\'m sorry. I meant drop dead, comrade. - Where was he found? - In Mexico. They were digging in the dirt, looking for this stuff. You\\'re not from around here, are you? Where is it you would imagine I am from, Dr. Jones? Well, the way you\\'re sinking your teeth into those wubble-u\\'s, I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine. Highest marks. Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko. Three times I have received Order of Lenin. Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor. And why? Because I know things. I know them before anyone else. And what I do not know, I find out. Now, what I need to know now is in here. - You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones. - Ouch. So, we will do this, what is expression, old-fashioned way. You will tell us. You will help us find what we seek. This warehouse is where you and your government have hidden all of your secrets, yes? This is a military warehouse. I\\'ve never been here before in my life. Object we seek, rectangular storage container, dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter by 66 centimeters. Contents of box, mummified remains. This is no doubt familiar to you. What makes you think I\\'ve got any idea what box you\\'re talking about? Because 10 years ago you were part of the team that examined it. Look... Even if I knew what you were talking about... You will help us find it. Compass. I need a compass. You know, north, south, east... West. No compass? I need your bullets. The contents of that box are highly magnetized. I need gunpowder. You want my help or not? Don\\'t toy with me, Dr. Jones. What is the point of all this? If it\\'s still magnetic, the metal in this gunpowder should point the way. Shells. Give me some shotgun shells. Pliers. Drop the guns, or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead. Why, Mac? Well, what can I say, Jonesey? I\\'m a capitalist, and they pay. After all those years we spent spying on the Reds? I thought we were friends, Mac. I\\'ve had a run of bad luck with the cards lately, mate. Awful. Bloody awful. I can\\'t go home empty-handed again. No defiant last words, Dr. Jones? I like Ike. Put down gun. You got it, pal. Damn, I thought that was closer. Come on. Come on. He\\'s not to get out of here alive! Block the exits! Don\\'t get clever, Boris. You don\\'t know him. Know him. Know him. You don\\'t know him!

We did 20, 30 missions together in Europe and the Pacific. Don\\'t wave your war record in our face, Colonel Jones. We all served. No kidding? What side were you on? I don\\'t think you recognize the gravity of your situation. You aided and abetted KGB agents who broke into a top-secret military installation in the middle of the United States of America, my country. What was in the steel box they took? You tell us. You\\'ve seen it before. You mean that Air Force fiasco in \\'47. I was tossed into a bus with blacked-out windows and 20 people I wasn\\'t allowed to speak to. Hauled out in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere on some urgent recovery project and shown what? Pieces of wreckage and an intensely magnetic shroud covering mutilated remains? None of us was ever given the full picture. And we were threatened with treason if we ever talked about it. So, you tell me, what was in the box? Indy, thank God. Don\\'t you know it\\'s dangerous to climb into a refrigerator? Those things can be deathtraps! Good to see you, too, Bob. Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones. What the hell is going on? KGB on American soil? Who is that woman? Describe her. Tall, thin, mid-30s, carried a sword of some kind, a rapier, I think. Yeah, that\\'s her. You sure she\\'s here? Here and gone. Who is she? Irina Spalko, she was Stalin\\'s fair-haired girl. His favorite scientist, if you can call psychic research science. General Ross... She\\'s leading teams from the Kremlin all over the world. Scooping up artifacts she thinks might have paranormal military applications. - General Ross! - Back off, Paul. Not everyone in the Army\\'s a Commie and certainly not Indy. What exactly am I being accused of, besides surviving a nuclear blast? Nothing yet. But frankly your association with George McHale makes all your activities suspicious, including those during the war. Are you nuts? Do you have any idea how many medals this son of a bitch won? A great many, I\\'m sure. But does he deserve them? Dr. Jones, let\\'s just say for now that you are of interest to the Bureau. Of great interest. Grooved Ware in the beginning of modern drainage practices, which we also see in Skara Brae on the west coast of Scotland. Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C. and was continuously occupied for 600 years until it was apparently abandoned in 2500 B.C. There\\'s no clear evidence as to why its occupants decided to abandon a perfectly healthy environment. Yes? - May I have a moment, Professor? - Yes. Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4. When I come back we\\'ll discuss the difference between migration and exodus. What? You have no idea the pressure coming from the Board of Regents. The FBI showed up this morning, ransacked your office, searched all your files! You\\'re the dean of the college. Why didn\\'t you stop them? They have no right. They had every right! They weren\\'t vandals. They were federal agents with search warrants! The university isn\\'t gonna get itself embroiled in that kind of controversy, not in this charged climate. So you\\'re firing me. A leave of absence is all. An indefinite leave of absence. - You are firing me. - During which they\\'ve agreed to continue to pay your full salary for a period... I don\\'t want their money! Please don\\'t be foolish. You don\\'t know what I had to go through to get that for you. You went through? What exactly did you have to go through, Charlie? Henry... I resigned. Where will you go? Train to New York, overnight to London, for starts. I might end up teaching in Leipzig. Heinrich owes me a favor. I\\'ll wire you when I get settled. You can send on the rest of my things. I suppose there\\'s nothing to keep you here. I barely recognize this country anymore. The government\\'s got us seeing Communists in our soup. When the hysteria reaches academia, I guess it\\'s time to call it a career. How did Deirdre take the news? How does any wife take such things? The look on her face was a combination of pride and panic. I never should\\'ve doubted you, my friend. No, you have reason to question your friends these days. Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie? First Dad, then Marcus. We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away. Just another half glass. Hey! Hey, old man! Professor, hello! Hey! Are you Dr. Jones? You\\'re running out of platform, kid. Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley\\'s? - Harold Oxley? The archeologist? - Yeah. What about him? They\\'re going to kill him. I haven\\'t talked to Harold Oxley in 20 years. He\\'s a brilliant guy. He could put you to sleep just by talking. Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid, that\\'s how I did get to sleep. Oxley\\'s voice was better than a glass of warm milk, you know. The name\\'s Mutt, Mutt Williams. - Mutt? What kind of name is that? - Yeah. It\\'s the one I picked. You got a problem with it? Take it easy. What was your relationship to Oxley? My dad died in the war. Ox kind of helped my mom raise me. You were saying somebody\\'s going to kill him? Six months ago, my mom gets a letter from the Ox. He\\'s down in Peru. Found some type of skull, a crystal skull. Like the one that guy Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss? - The one he found. - Nice jacket. The Ox and I were obsessed with the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college. How do you know about it? Are you kidding? It\\'s all he talked about. He\\'d talk about that thing till the cows come home. What\\'s it? It\\'s like an idol? Deity carving. Mesoamerican. There are a number of crystal skulls in the world. I saw one in the British Museum. Interesting craftsmanship, but that\\'s about it. All right, well, laugh if you want. Oxley said he found it this time. He said this was real and he was off to a place called Akator with it. - Akator? He said that? You\\'re sure? - Yeah. That\\'s what he said. He said Akator. What is it? It\\'s a mythical lost city in the Amazon. Conquistadors called it El Dorado. Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago to build a giant city out of solid gold. It had aqueducts and paved roads and technology that wouldn\\'t be seen again for 5,000 years. Francisco de Orellana disappeared into the Amazon looking for it in 1546. I almost died of typhus looking for it myself. I don\\'t think it exists. Why would Ox want to take the skull there? The legend says that a crystal skull was stolen from Akator in the 15th or 16th century, and that whoever returns the skull to the city temple will be given control over its power. Power. Right. So there\\'s some kind of power. What\\'s the power? I don\\'t know, kid. It\\'s just a story. No. From his letter, my mom thought the Ox was off his rocker. You know, smog in the noggin, so she goes down there to find him, only he\\'d already been kidnapped. Now they\\'ve got her, too. Now, Ox said he hid that skull someplace, and if my mom doesn\\'t come up with it, they\\'re gonna kill them both. Now, she said you\\'d help me. Me? What\\'s your mom\\'s name again? Mary. Mary Williams. You remember her? There were a lot of Marys, kid. Shut up! That\\'s my mother you\\'re talking about! All right? That\\'s my mother. You don\\'t have to get sore all the time just to prove how tough you are. Sit down. Please. Sit down. She said if anybody could find the skull, it\\'s you. Like you\\'re some type of... Like a grave robber or something. I\\'m a tenured professor of archeology. Oh, you\\'re a teacher. Well, that\\'s gonna be a big help. Anyway, she called me two weeks ago from South America. Said she\\'d escaped, but they were after her. She said she\\'d just gotten a letter from the Ox and mailed it to me so I could give it to you. Then the line went dead. I opened it. I mean, the thing\\'s pointless, though. It\\'s just gibberish. It\\'s not even English lettering. See? See those two bricks over there, at the counter? I don\\'t think they\\'re here for the milkshakes. Who are they? Don\\'t know. Maybe FBI. Come quietly, Dr. Jones. Make that KGB. - And bring letter with you. - Letter? What letter? Letter Mr. Williams just give you. Me? Do I look like a mailman? We don\\'t ask again. Come now or we\\'ll... Or what? Nice try, kid, but I think you just brought a knife to a gunfight. Outside now. - Hit this guy. - Who? Joe College. Hit him hard. - Here, hold this. - What? That\\'s my boyfriend! Take it outside! Get that greaser! Your mom didn\\'t escape. They let her go, so she could mail the letter and you could bring it to me and I could translate it! Get on, gramps! Go, go, go, go, go! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! This is crazy! Somebody\\'s going to get hurt! Left! Go left! Left! Move, move! Move! Split, split! Split, split! - You\\'re going too fast. - That\\'s a matter of opinion! - Excuse me, Dr. Jones. - Yes? I just had a question on Hargrove\\'s normative culture model. Forget Hargrove. Read Vere Gordon Childe on diffusionism. He spent most of his life in the field. If you want to be a good archeologist, you got to get out of the library! Who is that? Francisco de Orellana, the conquistador. Remember, the guy who got lost looking for the skull. And just as I thought. Koihoma. What\\'s that? It\\'s an extinct Latin American language. Pre-Columbian syllabic base. See. Diagonal stresses on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma. - You speak it? - Nobody speaks it. It hasn\\'t been heard aloud in 3,000 years. I might be able to read a bit though if I walk it through Mayan first. You know, for an old man, you ain\\'t bad in a fight. Thanks a lot. What are you, like, 80? It\\'s a riddle. Leave it to Ox to write a riddle in a dead language. \"Follow the lines in the earth only gods can read \"which lead to Orellana\\'s cradle \"guarded by the living dead.\" - He\\'s talking about the Nazca Lines. - What are those? Hold on here. Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings carved into the desert floor in Peru. From the ground, they don\\'t look like anything. But from the sky, only the gods can read them, because only gods live up there. Oxley\\'s telling us the skull is in Nazca, Peru. Finally. They saw him. Ox wandered into town a couple of months ago, raving like a madman. Police locked him up in the sanitarium. It\\'s this way. I took Spanish and I didn\\'t understand a word of that. What was it? Quechua, local Incan dialect. - Where\\'d you learn that one? - Long story. I got time. I rode with Pancho Villa. A couple of his guys spoke it. Bullshit! - You asked. - Pancho Villa? - Technically, I was kidnapped. - By Pancho Villa? It was the fight against Victoriano Huerta. - How old were you? - About your age. Your parents must\\'ve had a cow, huh? It worked out. Things were a little tense at home. Yeah, me and my mom aren\\'t on the best of terms, either. Treat her right, kid. You only get one and sometimes not for that long. It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s hers. She just got P.O.\\'ed because I quit school. She thinks I\\'m some kind of goof or something. - You quit school? - Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them. Fancy prep schools that teach you how to debate and chess and fencing. I\\'m great with the blade. I just think it\\'s a waste of time. - You never finished. - No. Just a bunch of useless skills. Wrong books. \\'Cause I love reading. Me and Ox used to read all the time. But now I can pick them myself. You get me? - What do you do for money? - Fix motorcycles. Gonna do that for the rest of your life? Maybe I will, Teach. You got a problem with that? No. Not if that\\'s what you love doing. Don\\'t let anybody tell you different. This is it. Sister. She says Ox isn\\'t here. She doesn\\'t know where he is. Some men came and took him away, men with guns. She says he was obsessed, deranged. Drew pictures all over the walls of his cell. This riddle in Oxley\\'s letter doesn\\'t make any sense. \"Follow the lines that only the gods can read that lead to Orellana\\'s cradle.\" Cradle, cradle, birth. Orellana wasn\\'t born in Peru. He was born in Spain. He was a conquistador. He came here for the gold. What happened to him? He disappeared along with six others. Their bodies were never found. He must have lost his mind. Ox, man, what happened? What happened? This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull. Look at the elongated cranium. And the same word in different languages, over and over again. Return. Return where? Or return what? You mean the skull? Seems to have been on his mind. Where was he supposed to return it to? - Sweep. - Yeah. Ox didn\\'t mean Orellana\\'s birthplace. Cradle has another meaning in Mayan. Literally, it means \"resting place,\" as in final resting place. Ox meant Orellana\\'s grave. This drawing scratched into the floor is the cemetery where he\\'s buried. You said Orellana vanished and nobody ever found his grave. Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did. \"Grave robbers will be shot.\" Good thing we\\'re not grave robbers. - What are we looking for? - I don\\'t know yet. Maybe an antechamber off one of these barrows. I think I just saw something! Oh, you\\'re jumping at shadows. This way down. - This way up. - Yeah. Those darts are poison! Stay there. You\\'re a teacher? Part-time. Dead end. Maybe. What are you doing? Put that thing away. Give me some light over here. Bring it over here. It\\'s just a thing. Dance on your own dime, will you? One of the scorpions just stung me! Am I gonna die? - How big? - Huge! - Good. - Good? When it comes to scorpions, the bigger the better. A small one bites you, don\\'t keep it to yourself. Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man. Like the drawings in Oxley\\'s cell. Means we\\'re getting closer. That\\'s crazy. Why is it like that? Nazca Indians used to bind their infants\\' heads with rope to elongate the skull like that. - Why? - Honor the gods. No, no. God\\'s head is not like that, man. Depends on who your god is. You\\'re going nowhere fast. Professor, this really is a dead end. Look. Hey! Come on, genius. Bring the backpack. - This is incredible. - Unreal. Don\\'t touch anything. Footprints. Somebody\\'s been here. Recently. Two sets of prints. Same size, could have been the same person twice. Not bad, kid. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Orellana and his men might\\'ve made it out of the jungle after all. Give me some light. You don\\'t have a knife, do you? Looks like he just died yesterday. It\\'s the wrappings. They preserved him. What just happened? He\\'s been wrapped up for 500 years. Air doesn\\'t agree with him. Thanks. I don\\'t want to keep borrowing yours all the time. - That\\'s fine. - I was going to put it back. Is this one open already? It\\'s him. It\\'s Orellana himself. They called him The Gilded Man. His lust for gold was legendary. It\\'s odd. Somebody\\'s been here and gone. But they left all this gold and all the artifacts. What were they looking for? - Hold this. - No. No. Unbelievable. No tool marks. A single piece of seamless quartz. Cut across the grain. It\\'s not possible, even with today\\'s technology, it would shatter. Crystal\\'s not magnetic. Neither is gold. What is this thing? Maybe the Nazca Indians thought this was their god. - You think this is the one from... - From Akator. Maybe the Spaniards found this skull along with all this other loot. They were headed for their ships along the shore. Maybe the Indians caught up with them, or they got to squabbling amongst themselves over their prize, kill each other off. The Indians wrap them up and bury them. A couple of hundred years later, Oxley shows up here, finds the skull. Takes it away, maybe to Akator. But then he returns it here. Return. Return, like he wrote on the walls of his cell. He put it back where he found it. Why? - Hello, Jonesey. - Hello, Mac. You\\'re lucky I turned up, Jonesey. Dovchenko there wanted to blow your brains out. That\\'s the third time I\\'ve saved your life. Unshackle me. I\\'ll give you a big hug. You had a Luger pointed at the base of your skull the first time we met. I had the situation under control. - You owe me. - What do you owe them? After the war, when you turned, how many names did you give the Reds? You\\'re not looking at the big picture here. How many good men died because of you? Eventually, they\\'re gonna let me out of this chair, comrade, and when they do, I\\'m going to break your nose. \"Comrade\"? You think this is about flags? About uniforms? You think this is about lines on a map? It\\'s just about money, isn\\'t it? No. Not only money. A gigantic pile of money. Don\\'t worry about what the Russians will pay. It\\'s nothing compared to what\\'s at Akator. An entire city of gold. It\\'s what the conquistadors were after. For God\\'s sake, Jonesey, we\\'d be rich! Richer than Howard Hughes! Blood money, every nickel. I need you to see the angle here, mate. Be smart. Do the right thing. Just like in... Like in Berlin. Got me? Just like in Berlin. You want me to trot off, or should we sing a song? How fortunate our failure to kill you, Dr. Jones. You survive to be of service to us once again. Well, you know me, always glad to help. \"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\" You recognize those words? It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer after he created the atomic bomb. He was quoting the Hindu bible. It was nuclear intimidation. But now this next level of weapon is ours to have, yours to fear. Weapon? What weapon? A mind weapon. A new frontier of psychic warfare. That was Stalin\\'s dream. Now I know why Oxley put the skull back where he found it. He knew you were looking for it. That skull is no mere deity carving. Surely you knew that the moment you laid eyes on it. It was not made by human hands. Who made it, then? Come on. The body we found in New Mexico was not the first. We\\'d already dissected two others from similar crash sites in Soviet Union. Saucer men from Mars. The legends about Akator are all true. Early men could not have conceived it, much less built it. It was a city of supreme beings with technologies and paranormal abilities. You got to be kidding me. Why do you choose not to believe your own eyes? The New Mexico specimen gave us hope. Unlike the others we\\'d found, its skeleton was pure crystal. A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they, too, were sent to find Akator. Perhaps we\\'re all searching for the same thing. - There is no other explanation. - There\\'s always another explanation. The skull was stolen from Akator in the 15th century. Whoever returns it... Returns it to the city temple will gain control over its powers. I\\'ve heard that bedtime story before. It\\'s a legend. Why do you think Akator even existed? You should ask your friend that question. We\\'re certain he\\'s been there. Oxley? Ox, it\\'s me, Indy. Ox? Ox, you\\'re faking it, right? \"Through eyes that last I saw in tears...\" Ox, listen to me, pal. Your name is Harold Oxley. You were born in Leeds, England. You and I went to school together at the University of Chicago. And you were never this interesting. My name is... My name is Henry Jones, Jr. What have you done to him? We ain\\'t done a thing. It\\'s the bloody skull. He is the divining rod that will lead us to Akator. But we need someone to interpret him for us. His mind, it seems, is quite weak. Let\\'s hope yours is stronger. The skull\\'s crystal stimulates an undeveloped part of the human brain, opening a psychic channel. Oxley lost control of his mind by staring too long into its eyes. We believe you can get through to him after you have done the same. I\\'ve got a better idea. You look at it. The skull does not speak to everyone, it seems. Surely you\\'re not afraid, Dr. Jones. You\\'ve spent your entire life searching for answers. Think of the truth behind those eyes. There may be hundreds of skulls at Akator. Whoever finds them will control the greatest natural force the world has ever known. Power over the mind of man. Be careful, you might get exactly what you wish for. I usually do. Imagine. To peer across the world and know the enemy\\'s secrets. To place our thoughts into the minds of your leaders. Make your teachers teach the true version of history, your soldiers attack on our command. We\\'ll be everywhere at once, more powerful than a whisper, invading your dreams, thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep. We will change you, Dr. Jones, all of you, from the inside. We will turn you into us. And the best part? You won\\'t even know it\\'s happening. Return. Return? That\\'s enough. That\\'s enough. If he dies, we can\\'t get there. Cover it. Henry. You all right, Jonesey? - You broke my nose! - I told you. Enough! You will speak to Oxley and lead us to Akator, yes? Take him outside. - You all right, kid? - They left my bike at the cemetery. - Yeah, but you\\'re all right? - They left my bike. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. I\\'m ready. Don\\'t give these pigs a thing. You heard him. Clearly I have chosen the wrong pressure point. Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one. Get your hands off me, you rotten Russki son of a bitch! Indiana Jones. About time you showed up. - Mom! - Sweetheart. \"Mom\"? What are you doing here? Forget about me. Are you all right? - \"Mom\"? - Young man, I specifically told you - not to come here. - Marion is your mother? You never wrote that. You never said that in any phone calls. Marion Ravenwood is your mother? For God\\'s sake, Indy, it\\'s not that hard. No, I mean, I just never thought... I would have a life after you left. - That\\'s not what I meant. - A damn good life! - Well, that\\'s fine. - A damn good, really good life! - Well, so have I! - Yeah? You still leaving a trail of human wreckage, or have you retired? Why? You looking for a date? With anybody but you. So, Dr. Jones, you will help us? A simple \"yes\" will do. Oh, Marion, you had to go and get yourself kidnapped. Not like you did any better. Same old, same old. Henry Jones, Jr. - Henry Jones, Jr... - That\\'s right, Ox. Listen to me. \"To lay their just hands on that Golden Key - \"that ope\\'s the Palace of Eternity.\" - Palace of... It\\'s from Milton. He\\'s said it before. Why? Ox, you got to tell us how to get to Akator or they\\'re gonna kill Marion. \"Through eyes that last I saw in tears, here in death\\'s dream kingdom...\" Harold, they\\'re gonna kill Abner\\'s little girl. Harold, they\\'re gonna kill Abner\\'s little girl. You got to tell us how to get there. We need... Get me paper. Something to write with. Autowriting! I should have seen this. - Henry Jones, Jr. - Right. That\\'s right, Ox. Three times it drops. The way down. - Three times... - Pictographs. Ideograms. Good, Ox. Good. Ox? It\\'s me, Ox. It\\'s Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me. Look at me. It\\'s me. It\\'s me. The wavy lines mean water, of course. Closed eyes mean sleep. The sun with the arc over the sky stands for time, duration. The word \"now\" is \"until.\" These two close together, the horizon and the snake, mean one thought. The horizon stood for the world, but it didn\\'t mean the Earth. It meant big, great. \"The water sleeps until the great snake.\" These aren\\'t just drawings, they\\'re directions. Get me a map! The great snake is the Amazon, of course, but \"sleep,\" what water sleeps? Here! Sono. The Portuguese word for \"sleep.\" Yes, good. Exactly. He wants us to follow this curve of the Sono down to where it meets the Amazon to the southeast. After that, I\\'m not sure. Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes... I have no idea what he means. This could be the route, though. It\\'s a completely unexplored part of the canopy. Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! - Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid? - They were going to kill us! - Well, maybe. - Somebody had to do something! - Something else would have been good. - At least I got a plan. This is intolerable. Harold, for God\\'s sake, keep up. Mom? - Stay back! - Stop! Stop! Stop! Don\\'t move. Moving makes space, space will make you sink. No, I think I can get out if I can just... Stop it! You\\'re pulling against a vacuum. It\\'s like trying to lift a car. Just stay calm. Okay, I\\'m calm. - What is it? Quicksand? - I\\'m calm. - No, it\\'s a dry sand pit. - I\\'m sinking, but I\\'m calm. Quicksand is a mix of sand, mud and water. And depending on the viscosity, it\\'s not as dangerous - as people sometimes think. - For Pete\\'s sake, Jones, we\\'re not in school! Don\\'t worry. There\\'s nothing to worry about unless there\\'s a... A void collapse. I\\'ll go get something to pull you out. Ox, don\\'t just sit there. For God\\'s sake, man, go get help! - Help? - Help! Help? Help! Go! Mutt can be a little impetuous. It\\'s not the worst quality in the world. Keep your arms above the surface. When the kid comes back, grab on. - Indy, he... - He\\'s a good kid, Marion. You should get off his back about school. - Mutt, I mean... - Not everybody\\'s cut out for it. His name is Henry! Henry. Good name. He\\'s your son. My son? Henry Jones the Third. Why the hell didn\\'t you make him finish school? - Mom, grab on! Grab it! - Yeah. I got it. Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull! Pull! Grab on. - Grab it. - Just grab it, Indy. It\\'s a rat snake! - Rat snakes aren\\'t that big. - Well, this one is, all right? It\\'s not even poisonous. Now grab on! - Go get something else. - Like what? Like a rope or something. There\\'s no Sears and Roebuck here! Grab the snake! - Maybe I can touch the bottom. - There\\'s no bottom. Now grab it. No, I think I can feel it with my feet. - Grab the snake! - Stop calling it that! It\\'s a snake! What do you want me to call it? - Say \"rope.\" - What? Say \"grab the rope.\" - Grab the rope! - Grab the rope! Hold tight. It\\'s slimy. Pull! Get rid of that thing, will you, Son? Afraid of snakes. You are one crazy old man. Why do you have to do everything the hard way, Jonesey? Good work, Ox. Thanks. Help. No. No, he was British. My dad was an RAF pilot. He was a war hero, not some schoolteacher! No, sweetheart. Colin was your stepfather. We started dating when you were three months old. He was a good man. Wait, wait, wait. Colin? As in Colin Williams? You... You married him? I introduced you! I think you gave up your vote on who I married when you decided to break it off a week before the wedding! I think we both knew, Marion, it wasn\\'t going to work. You didn\\'t know that. Why didn\\'t you ever talk to me about it? Because we never had an argument I won! It\\'s not my fault if you can\\'t keep up! I didn\\'t want to hurt you! For love of God, shut the hell up! Didn\\'t you ever wonder years ago why Ox stopped talking to you? He hated that you ran away. Would you two just stop? Yeah, Marion, let\\'s not let the kid see mom and dad fight. - You\\'re not my dad, okay? - You bet I am. And I got news for you. You\\'re gonna go back and finish school. Really? What happened to, \"There\\'s not a damn thing wrong with it, kid, \"and don\\'t let anybody else tell you any different\"? You don\\'t remember saying that? That was before I was your father! - You\\'re not my father! - Oh, yes, he is your father. You should have told me about the kid, Marion. I had a right to know. You vanished after that. - I wrote. - A year later! By then, Mutt was born and I was married! Why are you bothering to tell me now? Because I thought we were gonna die! Not yet! Got it? Oh, shit. I\\'m sure I wasn\\'t the only one to go on with my life. There must\\'ve been plenty of women for you over the years. Yeah. There were a few, but they all had the same problem. Yeah? What\\'s that? They weren\\'t you, honey. We got to get Oxley back, get our hands on that skull and get to Akator before they do. Grab the wheel. What\\'s he gonna do now? - I don\\'t think he plans that far ahead. - Yeah. - Scooch over, will you, Son? - Don\\'t call me \"son.\" Don\\'t. I think I\\'d cover my ears if I were you. Duck! Duck! Move, move! Pull up next to that duck. Henry Jones, Jr. Jones! Come on! Come on! Get down! Ox has got the skull. Marion, take the wheel. That\\'s not fair. She drove the truck. Don\\'t be a child. Find something to fight with. Jonesey! - Jonesey! - Hi, Mac. - Indy. Indy! Indy! - Shut up! Shut up! - You stupid son of a bitch! I\\'m CIA. - CIA. I almost screamed it at you in the tent. I said, \"Just like Berlin.\" What were we in Berlin, mate? - Double agents! - The skull! Throw me the skull! Throw me the skull! Riposte. Riposte. Get on your front foot. Riposte. It\\'s not a match, Mom. You fight like a young man, eager to begin, quick to finish. Mutt, disengage! Hey! Hey, I got the skull! - Throw the bag! Throw it! - Throw the bag! - Gun! - Gun! What are you looking at, Daddy-o? She\\'s getting away! This is very dangerous. <i>Do svidanya,</i> Dr. Jones. Jones! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Turn! - Siafu. - What? Big damn ants! Go! Run to the river! Get to the river! Jump in! Come on! Come on! Mom, there\\'s a cliff! - Jonesey, come on! - Get in, Jones! - Mom, stop. - Mom, slow down. - Honey, stop. - Slow down, Mom. - You\\'re gonna go off the cliff. - That\\'s the idea. - Bad idea. Give me the wheel. - Trust me! Slow down! - Don\\'t ever do that again. - Yes, dear. Three times it drops. Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse! - I\\'m trying! I\\'m trying! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom! The way down. He means by land. He came by land. - Three times it drops? - Three times it drops. What is he talking about? He means one! Two! Three. You okay? Babe? Let go. \"Through eyes that last I saw in tears.\" \"The golden vision reappears!\" Gold. I\\'m in. Through eyes... Through eyes in tears. We got to go through that waterfall! The skull has to be returned. I\\'ll do it. Nobody else has to come. Who cares? It\\'s brought us nothing but trouble. Look what it did to him. - I have to return it. - Why you? Because it told me to. - Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal. - Oxy, stay with us. How old is this? Four or five thousand years. Old as the pyramids. Look, sun worshippers, like the Egyptians. This is fresh. These were just used. More worshippers. Yeah, but that\\'s not the sun they\\'re worshipping. Someone came and taught the Ugha farming. Irrigation. Ox, what is it? I think I understand, Ox. Someone came? Are they the same? There were more. Look. Thirteen in a circle. Show us the way, Ox. - Let\\'s go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go! - Go! Indy! Jonesey! Oxley! You were here before. How did you get past them? Come on, Mac. Come on! Come on, Mac. Come on, come on, come on. \"To lay their just hands on that Golden Key - \"that ope\\'s the Palace of Eternity.\" - Come on, Ox. You did good, Ox. You did good. City of gold. So where\\'s all the gold? Look at the state of this place. What a stupid legend. What a waste of my time. Ox was here before, but he couldn\\'t get into the temple, so he took the skull back to the cemetery, where he found it. \"To lay their just hands on that Golden Key \"that ope\\'s the Palace of Eternity.\" Key that ope\\'s the palace. The obelisk. The obelisk is the key? What are you looking for, Ox? What are you doing? You figured this out in your cell, didn\\'t you, Professor? Excuse me, Professor. Well done. Go get your own. Listen. Hear that? Get up! Move! Ox, move! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! This is not good. Move, Ox! Move! Quick! Quick! Quick! I don\\'t like this! I don\\'t like it! - Mom, come on! - Jonesey! He dropped it. He dropped the skull! Okay? Hold this. Ox, you okay? Lovely. All right, let\\'s go. This way? Now that\\'s more like it. There are artifacts from every era of early history. Macedonian. - Sumerian. - This place is the mother lode. Etruscan. Babylonian. There isn\\'t a museum in the world that wouldn\\'t sell its soul for this lot. Early Egyptian. Dozens of museums. Hundreds of them, Jonesey! Collectors. They were archeologists. How do we open it? I\\'ll give it back, Ox. I promise. No more forever waiting. Soon now. Sorry, Jonesey. So what are you, a triple agent? Nah, I just lied about being a double. Look at them! Still waiting for the return of the one who was lost. They are a hive mind. One being physically separate, but with a collective consciousness. More powerful together than they can ever be apart.

Go! Go! Like a broom to their footprints. Where did they go? Space? Not into space. Into the space between spaces. I don\\'t understand. Why this legend of a city of gold? The Ugha word for gold translates as \"treasure.\" But their treasure wasn\\'t gold. It was knowledge. Knowledge was their treasure. What? We\\'re just going to sit here?

I didn\\'t do anything. No, but you will. It\\'s very important that you live. This isn\\'t true. How could that man just get up after you... He\\'s not a man. A machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdine systems model 101. A machine? - Like a robot? - Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism. - No. He was bleeding. - Just a second. Get your head down! All right, listen. The Terminator\\'s an infiltration unit... part man, part machine. Underneath, it\\'s a hyperalloy combat chassis... microprocessor controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside, it\\'s living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood... grown for the cyborgs. Look, Reese, I don\\'t know what you want from... Pay attention! I got to ditch this car. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human... Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him. Look... I am not stupid, you know. They cannot make things like that yet. Not yet. Not for about forty years. - Are you saying it\\'s from the future? - One possible future. From your point of view... I don\\'t know tech stuff. Then you\\'re from the future, too, is that right? - Right. - Right. Cyborgs don\\'t feel pain. I do. Don\\'t do that again. - Just let me go. - Listen! And understand. That Terminator is out there. It can\\'t be bargained with. It can\\'t be reasoned with. It doesn\\'t feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead. Can you stop it? I don\\'t know. With these weapons, I don\\'t know. <i>POLICE RADIO: All units. All units. Gray Ford suspect vehicle\\'s been found</i> <i>in a parking structure at 4th and Beaudry.</i> Reese. Why me? Why does it want me? There was a nuclear war... A few years from now. All this... This whole place. Everything. It\\'s gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here. There. Nobody even knew who started it. It was the machines, Sarah. - I don\\'t understand. - Defense network computers. New... powerful... Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart... a new order of intelligence. Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond... extermination. Did you see this war? (TIRES SCREECH) No. I grew up after it... In the ruins. Starving... - Hiding from HKs. - HKs? Hunter-killers. Patrol machines built in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps for orderly disposal. This was burned in by laser scanner. Some of us were kept alive... to work... Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever. But there was one man who taught us to fight, to storm the wire of the camps, to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk. He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink. His name was Connor. John Connor. Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son. (ENGINE WON\\'T TURN OVER) (ENGINE STARTS) (GUNSHOT) Drive! Reese! No, Reese! No! No! No!

No. They\\'ve been identified, and there\\'s no doubt. Oh, God. God! Ginger! Sarah. - Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman. - Hi, Sarah. I want you to tell him everything that Reese told you. - Do you feel up to that? - (SOBBING) Yeah. I guess so. You\\'re a doctor? - Criminal psychologist. - Is Reese crazy? Well, that\\'s what we\\'re gonna find out. (DISTANT SIREN) (WHIRRING) DR. SILBERMAN: So, you\\'re a soldier, fighting for whom? With the 132nd, under Perry. From \\'21 to \\'27. - That\\'s the year 2027? - That\\'s right. And I was assigned... This is fucking great. REESE: The last two years under John Connor. - Who was the enemy again? - A computer defense system built for... - (BEEP BEEP BEEP) - Oh, damn. Sorry. Built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdine systems. I see. And this, uh, computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, killing him, in effect, before he\\'s even conceived, a sort of retroactive abortion? That guy Silberman cracks me up. Last week, he had this guy in here that burned his Afghan. He screwed it first, - then he set it on fire. - Hey, shut up. Why didn\\'t the computer just kill Connor then? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator? It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed. We\\'d won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence. Is that when you captured the lab complex and found that... uh, what is it called? Uh... the time displacement equipment? That\\'s right. The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me to intercept, and they blew the whole place. How are you supposed get back? I can\\'t. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It\\'s just him and me. (COCKS RIFLE) It\\'s just him and me. Why didn\\'t you bring any weapons, something more advanced? Don\\'t you have ray guns? Ray guns. DR. SILBERMAN ON TAPE: Show me a piece of future technology. You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. - Nothing dead will go. - Why? - I didn\\'t build the fucking thing! - OK, OK. But this... - (SIGHS) Cyborg, if it\\'s metal... - Surrounded by living tissue! Oh. Right, right... This is great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy. You see how clever this part is? How it doesn\\'t require a shred of proof? And most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant. DR. SILBERMAN: Why were the other two women killed? Most of the records were lost in the war. Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor\\'s mother. Her full name, where she lived. They just knew the city. The Terminator was just being systematic. - Uh-huh. Well, let\\'s go back to... - Look, you have heard enough! I have answered your questions! Now I have to see Sarah Connor! - I\\'m afraid that\\'s not up to me. - Then why am I talking to you? - Because I can help you. - Who is in authority here? - Reese... - Shut up! You still don\\'t get it, do you? He\\'ll find her. That\\'s what he does! That\\'s all he does! You can\\'t stop him! He\\'ll wade through you, reach down her throat, and pull her fucking heart out! - Doc. - REESE: Let... let go of me! Sorry. - So, Reese is crazy? - In technical terminology... He\\'s a loon. Sarah, this is what they call body armor. Our TAC guys wear these. It\\'ll stop a twelve-gauge round. This other individual must have been wearing one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead. What about when he punched through the windshield? He was probably on PCP. Broke every bone in his hand and wouldn\\'t feel it for hours. There was this guy once... - You see this scar? - Here. Thank you. There\\'s a couch in this other room. Why don\\'t you stretch out and try to get some sleep? It\\'ll be at least an hour before your mother gets here from Big Bear. - I can\\'t sleep. - Try. Well, it may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable. You\\'ll be perfectly safe. We got thirty cops in this building. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. (BUZZ) (BEEP BEEP BEEP) I\\'m a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told that she\\'s here. Could I see her, please? No. You can\\'t see her. She\\'s making a statement. - Where is she? - Look, it may take a while... if you want to wait, there\\'s a bench over there. I\\'ll be back. MAN: What the hell was that?

I love you, mom.</i> I love you, too, sweetheart. <i>- MAN: Tiki motel.</i> - Give me your address there. SARAH: What have we got? Mothballs. Corn syrup. Ammonia. What\\'s for dinner? - Plastique. - Mmm, that sounds good. What is it? Nitroglycerin, basically. It\\'s a bit more stable. I learned to make it when I was a kid. Make sure there\\'s none on the threads. Like this. Screw the end cap on. Very gently. You must\\'ve had a fun childhood. That\\'s good. All right. Six more like that, and I\\'ll get started on the fuses. SARAH: He\\'ll find us, won\\'t he? Probably. It\\'ll never be over, will it? Look at me. I\\'m shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed. No. I\\'m not. Kyle... The women in your time... what are they like? Good fighters. That\\'s not what I meant. Was there someone special? - Someone? - A girl. You know. No. Never. Never? I\\'m sorry. I\\'m so sorry. So much pain. Pain can be controlled. You just disconnect it. So you feel nothing? John Connor gave me a picture of you once. I didn\\'t know why at the time. It was very old... Torn... faded. You were young like you are now. You seemed just... a little sad. I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment. I memorized every line, every curve. I came across time for you, Sarah. I love you. I always have. I shouldn\\'t have said that. Think fast! (CHUCKLES) (DOG BARKING) (BARKS) Trade places! Faster! Drive faster! (HORN HONKS) (KYLE GRUNTS) Kyle! Oh, my God! (TIRES SCREECHING) (SARAH SCREAMING) Kyle. - Whoa! - Son of a bitch! You stay here. Let\\'s get out of here. Get out. Kyle. Come on, get up. He\\'s coming. Kyle? Come on! Help me! Get out! Get out! Get out! SARAH: Come on! Faster! (KYLE PANTING) KYLE: Don\\'t stop! Run! Sarah! Kyle! Oh, Kyle. Kyle. We did it, Kyle. We got it. No! No! KYLE: Wait! - SARAH: What are you doing? - Cover, so he can\\'t track us. Come on! Come on. No, Kyle! - Come on! Come on! - Leave me here. SARAH: Get up! Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier! On your feet! Move it! Back. Go back. - Run, Sarah. - No. Run! Run! Come on, motherfucker. (SCREAMS IN PAIN) (SCREAMING) No, no. You\\'re terminated, fucker. (SIREN APPROACHING) Kyle. <i>POLICE RADIO: 6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i> (RADIO CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) SARAH: Tape 7, November 10. Where was I? What\\'s most difficult for me is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to. But I guess I have a while yet before you\\'re old enough to even understand these tapes. They\\'re more for me at this point, just so that I can get it straight. <i>- Gasolina, por favor. - ¿Cuánto?</i> <i>- Llena el tanque.</i> - Fill her up, <i>sí.</i> Should I tell you about your father? Boy, that\\'s a tough one. Will it affect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is your father? If you don\\'t send Kyle, you can never be. God, a person could go crazy thinking about this. I suppose I will tell you. I owe him that. Maybe it\\'ll help if... You know that in the few hours that we had together... We loved a lifetime\\'s worth. <i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora, y tengo pena decirle</i> <i>que me de cinco dolares americanos, pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i> - What did he just say? - He says you\\'re very beautiful, señora... and he\\'s ashamed to ask you for five American dollars for his picture, but if he doesn\\'t, his father will beat him. Pretty good hustle, kid. <i>- Cuatro - Sí, sí.</i> <i>Gracias.</i> <i>¡Miren, miren!</i> <i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i> What did he just say? He said there\\'s a storm coming in. I know.

This bloody wind! Polish the letters well. There are so many widows! The women here live longer than the men. Except poor Mom. Mom was lucky. Raimunda, don\\'t say that! She died in Dad\\'s arms, and she loved him more than anyone. Burned to death! That\\'s the worst way to die. They were asleep. They didn\\'t even realize. Even so, how can you say something like that! Hello, Agustina. See you later, Agustina. - Good morning, Manola. - Good morning. - Is that everything, Mom? - I\\'ll get the rest. This is wonderful! Good Lord! - Is this Paula? - Of course. She\\'s all grown up! Give her a kiss. She\\'s got your father\\'s eyes. - How are you? - Not good. Don\\'t say that. I want to give my grave the once-over. With this wind, you can\\'t keep it clean. - It looks lovely. - Cleaning it relaxes me. I often come and sit here on my own, and time goes by. We\\'re going now, we have to see Aunt Paula. Come and see me afterwards. Sure. How\\'s Paco? He\\'s fine. He stayed in Madrid, working. Mom, does Agustina really come and clean her own grave? Yes, it\\'s the custom here. They buy a plot and look after it all their lives, like a second home. - That freaks me out! - It\\'s tradition here. - Shall I drive? - Yes. Aunt Paula! Who is it? Raimunda! - Don\\'t take all day. - Don\\'t rush me. I don\\'t like going back in the dark. Be nice to Auntie, don\\'t laugh at her. All right. This house still smells of Mom. How are you, Aunt? You\\'re very thin! Have you had the baby? Fourteen years ago. Doesn\\'t time fly! And who are these? Who do you think? Sole and my Paula! The same name as me! And Sole. Shall we go into the dining room? That Sole looks like a right sourpuss. For Heaven\\'s sake! <i>... the wind carried</i> <i>the cinders to the bushes. </i> <i>The result is the most tragic fire</i> <i>in the last 13 years. </i> - Mind if I turn it off? - No, I can\\'t see it anyway. Fires are dreadful. That\\'s how your grandparents died. Why did I come in here? I don\\'t know. - To talk? - No. - To get some food? - Yes! Look in the sideboard. I\\'m very shaky on my pins. Look, wafers! Just like Mom\\'s. Eat up. How was the cemetery? Your mother is delighted. Did you scrub the headstone properly? Of course. She likes it to be clean. If she could, she\\'d clean it herself. But, of course, she can\\'t. Of course, she can\\'t. Don\\'t you feel lonely in this big house? No. You\\'d be better off in a home, where you\\'d be looked after. I\\'m fine as I am. I\\'m going to the bathroom. Well, go! You can\\'t live on your own. I\\'m worried about you. How do you manage your meals? Very well. Agustina brings me bread, your mother does the cooking, and if I need anything I call the store and they bring it... I\\'m fine. What a lovely touch! Look! It\\'s got your name on it. Shall we go? Yes. We\\'re leaving now. I\\'m so shaky on my pins. Don\\'t get up. How could I not get up? Next time I come back, I\\'m taking you home with me. Yes, next time. What matters is that you come back. You\\'ve gotten very wobbly. Take care of yourself. I will. Mind how you go! We\\'ll do that. I love you lots! - Shall we go to Agustina\\'s? - Yes. Come in! Well? How did you find your aunt? - Bad. - Terrible. She\\'s gotten very shaky. I don\\'t know how she copes. She does very well without going outside. She eats a stick of bread every day. She leaves the money for me. Let\\'s go onto the patio. She\\'s in an awful state, love. She doesn\\'t know what year it is. She talks about Mom as if she were still alive. For her, she isn\\'t dead. She can\\'t accept it. Sit down for a while. I\\'d like to pay you something to look in on her every day. I won\\'t accept anything! I\\'m very happy to do it. I\\'d take her home, but I\\'d have to throw my husband out to make room. But we have to do something. Every morning, before I go shopping, I tap on her window and I don\\'t move until she answers me. I keep an eye on her. I really appreciate that. I like to think... someone\\'s doing that for my mother, wherever she is. Look! Wasn\\'t she cutting edge then? The only hippie in the village. Look at her plastic jewelry. They\\'re awesome! First-rate plastic. Every time I smoke a joint I think of her. That\\'s a fine example you\\'re setting for Paula! There\\'s still no news? Nothing. It\\'s like the earth swallowed her up. And your sister Brigida? Her? She\\'s in Madrid, she\\'s a big hit on trash TV. Mom, I\\'m out of credit! Good, we\\'ll get a break from the telephone. You can use mine. - She\\'ll bankrupt you. - In that case, no. As I was saying, Brigida is on so many shows she can put a deposit on an apartment in Madrid. And she\\'s going to make a record. She always liked singing. So did this one. Remember when you and she, you must\\'ve been thirteen, went to an audition for child singers? Hey, you never told me that! It was your granny\\'s idea. She was up for anything. Talking of mothers, maybe yours hasn\\'t shown up so as not to ruin your sister\\'s career. No. Mom would love to be on television. She\\'d go crazy. Want some? No, no, no. I grow it myself. Look at the plants. We have to leave. Yes. Did you report her disappearance to the police? Brigida thinks it isn\\'t necessary. She\\'s said it so often on TV. Yes, but you have to report it to the police, not say it on TV. I don\\'t know. In any case, it\\'s not the first time she\\'s left home. But never for so long. It\\'s been over three years. Don\\'t give up hope. And take care of yourself, you don\\'t look well. Your oleander looks wonderful. Yes, it didn\\'t get aphids this year. But I\\'ve really lost my appetite. Maybe it\\'s the joints. No, if it weren\\'t for them, I wouldn\\'t eat at all. Your father\\'s eyes. A joint makes me feel a bit hungry, and it relaxes me. Safe journey! Guess what I saw upstairs beside the bathroom! What? An exercise bike. That freaks me out! Why would auntie want a bike if she can\\'t walk? Exactly, she\\'s lost her mind. Don\\'t talk like that about her. She didn\\'t even recognize us. It\\'s the wind. That goddamn East wind here drives people crazy! The wafers are delicious. How can she bake those when she\\'s as blind as a bat? Hello, Regina. Going to work? Got no choice, love. Why not give her a lift? Where are you going? To the club. If you drop me in the center that\\'d be great. - All right. - Thanks. See you later. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. Hello. Well? Did you have fun? In the cemetery? You kidding me? Were you having a party? Me? What do you mean? Paula, sit properly. Close your legs! Will you bring me another beer? Are you kidding? Go on, please. Haven\\'t you had enough? You have to work tomorrow. I\\'m free tomorrow, and the day after, too. How come? I was fired. Hang on. Christ Almighty! I\\'ll get a job on Sundays, it\\'s my only free day. I\\'ll get a job. But let me watch the game in peace. You can forget about soccer. There\\'ll be no more cable. We\\'re a poor family, and we\\'ll live like one. Paula, put that phone down! Your supper\\'s here if you want it. Are you angry? No. I\\'m worried about my aunt. She\\'s worse than ever. She didn\\'t even recognize Paula and Sole. - I don\\'t know how she manages. - But she does. Leave me be. What\\'s wrong? I\\'m worn out, and I have to get up early. I\\'ll do the work. Don\\'t be a pest! Don\\'t call me a pest. Sorry. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. What for? I called you loads of times to tell you to buy bread. I don\\'t suppose you thought to buy any. No. You\\'re soaked. How long have you been here? A while. Where were you? With your pals? No. I wasn\\'t anywhere. Why didn\\'t you answer the phone? What\\'s wrong? Is something wrong? Tell me, what\\'s happened? Where\\'s your father? He\\'s... Where? In the kitchen. What happened? I was in the kitchen, with my back to him and suddenly Dad jumped on me. He was drunk. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he wasn\\'t my father. I pushed him away. But he got up and put his arms around me. I pushed him again. He unzipped his pants. He kept saying that it wasn\\'t wrong and that he wasn\\'t my father! I took a knife from the drawer, and I threatened him, but it was only to scare him. He didn\\'t believe me. He said I wouldn\\'t dare... and he jumped on me. What are you going to do? I don\\'t know. Go and change, or you\\'ll get pneumonia. Remember, I killed him, and you saw nothing, you weren\\'t here. It\\'s very important you remember that. Don\\'t open! Who can it be? I don\\'t know. Go to your room. Raimunda, it\\'s me, Emilio. Coming! Hi there. I\\'m sorry, I know it\\'s late, but I\\'m going to Barcelona tomorrow. I want to give you the restaurant keys in case anyone comes to see it. I don\\'t mind, it\\'s just I\\'m never at home. What about Paco? He\\'s always here. Paco... He finally got a job. He\\'s starting tomorrow. Are you hurt? Women\\'s troubles. But now that I think about it, with Paco working I\\'ll have more free time. - Give me the keys, I\\'ll sort it out. - Here. This is my brother\\'s home number. The other is my cell phone. - You\\'re leaving tomorrow? - In the morning. Tell me, how much are you asking? I always liked your restaurant. It\\'s a pity you didn\\'t like the owner, too. Emilio, please... For the lease, five million, but it\\'s negotiable. We\\'ll miss you. And I\\'ll miss you girls. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Is Emilio leaving? - Yes. Go back to your room. I want to be with you. You\\'ll have to help me later. Don\\'t answer! It\\'ll be one of your pals. Answer it, tell them you can\\'t talk. This is no time to be calling. I can\\'t talk... What do you mean? It\\'s your Aunt Sole. Put your mother on. It\\'s Aunt Sole. Tell her I\\'m busy. She\\'s busy now. Put her on, it\\'s important. Take the phone, Mom. Sole, I\\'ve got a pile of ironing, and I was out working all afternoon. Agustina rang. Aunt Paula is dead. When? <i>A little while ago. </i> Aunt Paula is dead. Just a minute ago I was thinking of bringing her here. She died all alone! Don\\'t cry, pet. <i>Listen, Agustina said</i> <i>we\\'re not to worry. </i> She and Squinty will lay her out before we get there. Auntie had everything organized. She even chose her coffin and paid for everything. It\\'s incredible that she was so lucid at the end. I can\\'t go to the funeral. <i>I\\'m truly sorry, </i> but I\\'m very busy. How can you not go! What will people say! I can\\'t go, not remotely. You have to go on your own. On my own? <i>No way. </i> You know I\\'m terrified of the dead. But you needn\\'t see Auntie. I\\'ll tell Agustina to make sure of that. And if they ask for you? Say I\\'ve had a gallbladder operation. Anything. I\\'ll go later, but today it\\'s not remotely possible. I don\\'t understand you. Auntie loved you so much. And I loved her. I\\'ll explain it to you someday, and that day, you\\'ll flip. I\\'m flipping now. Take a tranquilizer, I\\'m going to take one, too. And you go tomorrow morning. All right? I guess... The door! Wait! You stay here. Stay here and keep watch. I hope it hasn\\'t changed since I worked here. DEEP FREEZE Stay where you are! Sorry. What do you want? Is the restaurant open? No. Why? Give me a hand. We\\'re shooting a film in the area, and I\\'m looking for somewhere we can all eat. Do you know any restaurants around here? How many are you? 25 and 5... 30. Come on, help me. I can do it for you, if you want. We were going to close today. So, lunch for thirty. At what time? We stop at 3:30, and we\\'re very close. Around 4:00? Yeah. And, tell me, how much...? Ten euros a head. That\\'s fine. I\\'m sorry I shouted at you... but you scared me. - Well, I\\'ll see you at 4:00. - Sure. Thanks a lot. It\\'s 10:00! - Two kilos. - Give me another two kilos. How much are the potatoes? 1.60 for four kilos. Give me eight kilos. Sure. Hello, Regina. Hello, you\\'re carting quite a load! I have to make lunch for 30. - Could you lend me 100 euros? - I\\'m broke, love. I\\'ve just bought a chunk of pork this big. I could use that. I\\'ll buy it from you. It cost me 10.80. It\\'s all I have! I\\'ll pay you tomorrow. Come on! I\\'ll bring it over to you now. - Thanks, love. - I\\'ll have to diet today. It\\'ll do you good. Hey, Inés! Back from the village? I got here yesterday. How are you? Did you happen to bring any sausages or chorizo? I certainly did! The sausages are great. My mother-in-law orders them specially for me. - I need a kilo or so. - Why\\'s that? - I have to cook for 30. - Who\\'s coming? I\\'ll tell you later. Can I buy them? I\\'ll pay you tomorrow. - Sure, it\\'s no problem. - Thanks. Did you bring anything sweet? I brought some cookies that melt in your mouth. With the way your glucose and cholesterol are, I can\\'t believe you brought cookies. It\\'s my only vice. Three boxes. You shouldn\\'t eat them. - What do I do, give them away? - Sell them to me. At least let me taste them. You can eat three or four, but don\\'t stuff yourself. - Bring them round to me, love. - I\\'ll do that. - Thanks. - Bye, love. Bye, pet. HOMEMADE FOOD \"SPANISH\" OMELET AND BLOOD SAUSAGE PORK SALAD Who\\'d like some pork? It\\'s delicious. You, too? Some pork? It\\'s delicious. Agustina? Is that you? Soledad, daughter. Sole, I have to talk to you. Sole! There, there. Take it easy. Where is she? Upstairs, in my mother\\'s room, the best room in the house. I brought her here to give her a better wake. Thank you so much. Come on, we\\'re the principal mourners. Good afternoon. I spoke to your sister. She\\'s just had an operation. Yes, what timing. She said you\\'re not to see the body. Don\\'t worry, you won\\'t have to. Say hello to Vicenta\\'s daughter. We\\'ll let her rest a while, she\\'s very tired. Come on. Over here. It was late at night. I\\'d had supper, and I was watching the television. I heard someone knocking at my door. I wasn\\'t sure, but just then I heard the same noise, and I asked, \"Who is it?\" And a voice answered, \"Agustina.\" I wasn\\'t afraid. I went outside, but I saw no one. I looked over at your aunt\\'s house, and the door seemed to be open. I thought it was odd, so I went in. I called your aunt, but she didn\\'t answer me. How could she answer me, poor thing? I went into her room, and I found her there, in bed, as still as a little bird! It was her spirit that warned you. But was it Paula\\'s spirit or the other one\\'s? One of the two. I can\\'t say who it was, I didn\\'t see. But just as I\\'m listening to you now, someone or something warned me that Paula had died, and opened the door so I could go in. Come into the kitchen. I bet you haven\\'t eaten yet. No. Not since last night, but I\\'m all right. I thought as much. This\\'ll do you good. Don\\'t give me any more! That\\'s enough. What did the women mean? It was just talk. You know what villages are like. They were talking about my mother. Some people say they\\'ve seen her. They say she came back to look after your Aunt Paula. Has she not appeared to you? No. What about you? No, but those things happen. I know. My grandfather, God rest him, appeared to my grandmother. At first she was frightened. Eat up! Then she asked him what he wanted, and his spirit told her there was a promise he hadn\\'t fulfilled. She carried it out, and the whole village went with her to the cemetery where they left my grandfather so he\\'d rest in peace. And he never appeared again. That isn\\'t just a story I heard. I lived it. Do you want to go into your aunt\\'s house in case you want to take anything? No, Raimunda will come later. Tell her it went very well and the whole village came. I\\'ll do that. I\\'m going to miss her so much! Go on. <i>Let me out, Sole! </i> <i>Let me out! </i> <i>I\\'m your mother. </i> <i>I won\\'t do anything to you. </i> My mother is dead. If you\\'re anything, you\\'re her ghost or her spirit. <i>Whatever you say, </i> <i>but get me out of here. </i> <i>I\\'m in the trunk of your car. </i> Really, Mom, the things you do! Soledad, daughter, don\\'t be afraid of me. I\\'m your mother. Aren\\'t you going to give me a hug? Now, give me a hand. Take this. - Auntie\\'s suitcase! - Yes. What is all this? Clothes, and some valuables Auntie had. A good thing I hid them before the neighbors arrived. Except for Agustina, they all went through everything, but I\\'d got there first. You\\'ll have to give Agustina a gift, she\\'s been so good. Better than your sister. There was such a fuss when she didn\\'t turn up. If you\\'d heard what Squinty said about her! Thank heavens you came. I\\'m wrecked after the trip. - Are you sleeping here? - Yes, where do you want me to go? What a sight! I\\'m not surprised I scared you. Do you still have the illegal hair salon? That\\'s how I make my living. - Is that the guest room? - Yes, that\\'s it. Tomorrow, you can give me a color and a trim. And I need dark glasses, too. I don\\'t want to be stuck in the house all day. I have to go out. Nobody knows me here. In the village, I couldn\\'t even go to the front door. I need a bit of air. Are you staying for long? You want to throw me out already? No, I\\'m just asking. I\\'ll stay for as long as God wills, if you don\\'t mind. When you tire of me, you just have to say so. But for a separated woman, who\\'s better company than her mother? Unless you\\'ve got yourself a sweety-pie. No, Mom. I\\'m alone, like always. Not anymore. Answer the phone. - Are you back? - <i>Yes. </i> You were out of range, so I rang Agustina. She said it all went very well. <i>The whole village came. </i> I\\'ve been thinking about you all day. I really wanted to be there. Hang on, Sole. 300. <i>- What do I owe for the drinks? </i> <i>- Nothing. </i> They\\'re on the house. - Well, tomorrow, same time. - Sure. - The crew was very happy. - I\\'m glad. If you don\\'t mind, and even if you charge more, could the helpings be more generous? Tomorrow, you\\'ll have food coming out your eyes. - Great, see you then. - So long. Sorry, Sole. Have you got a job in a restaurant, too? Yes, I\\'ve taken over Emilio\\'s place. Good Lord! <i>He was sick of it, </i> but that\\'s not the only news. Paco has left us. <i>That\\'s why I couldn\\'t</i> <i>go to the funeral. </i> We were having a row when you rang. I knew something was wrong. Did he hit you? Paco wasn\\'t violent. He\\'s just gone, <i>forever. </i> He\\'ll come back, you\\'ll see. I doubt it. Why are you so sure? You can tell these things. Well, so long. So long. Bye. None of the three of us had any luck with men. Raimunda and I didn\\'t, but you... Me, what? Dad adored you. Raimunda says that you were lucky, you died in the arms of the person you loved most. Your sister isn\\'t a bad person, but she\\'s got a nasty streak. I was blind about him, and he cheated on me until the day he died! - What do you mean? - It\\'s true. I kept that quiet all my life. I never wanted you two to know. But let\\'s drop it. I don\\'t want to talk ill of the dead. - Is he going to appear? - I hope not. And your husband? What about him? Might he turn up someday? I doubt it. I haven\\'t heard from him in two years. All the better. It\\'ll just be the two of us together. The pork cost you... 10? 10.80. - I\\'ll give you an extra 3 euros. - Thanks, love. And I\\'ll pay you for four boxes of cookies, not three. Thanks. I don\\'t want you to think I\\'d cheat you. Could you help me with this? I can\\'t move it on my own. - Where are you taking it? - To the restaurant. You\\'re the expert in removals. Where do we...? Get ahold of it, tip it over, but not all the way. - Otherwise, we won\\'t get it through. - Is this all right? Now, straighten up, to the right, more to the right... - We can\\'t see anything. - I\\'ll guide you. Careful, it\\'ll come this way. All the way... Don\\'t rush it. Are we at the door? The elevator is here. Wait, wait. This has to go in straight. I\\'ll take this end. You take it. You\\'re doing fine. Good Lord! This is tough. Careful! Call it from downstairs. I want them to see we don\\'t use frozen food. It\\'s all natural, fresh every day. Over to the corner. - And the other freezer? - It\\'s broken. So you\\'re taking over the restaurant? Yes, at least until the crew finishes the film. Then I\\'ll see. You can count on me. I make great desserts. And I can serve drinks at night. I don\\'t know if we\\'ll work nights, but I\\'m counting on you. - Sure. - And thanks. Mom... Is there anything you want me to do? Cut my hair. I mean, is there anything you left undone in life that won\\'t let you rest in peace? People always leave things undone, or done badly, and I\\'m no exception. But I don\\'t know if they can be fixed. And if they can, it\\'s up to me to fix them. My clients will be arriving soon. What\\'ll we do? Look after them. I\\'ll help you. But I can\\'t say you\\'re my mother. They know I\\'m an orphan. I\\'ll say I\\'m a foreigner. A foreigner? From where? Dominican Republic? No, there are lots around here, they\\'d notice your accent. Chinese? Madrid\\'s full of Chinese. Who\\'d believe you\\'re Chinese! Something we don\\'t have around here. Russian! Do I really look more Russian than Chinese? Yes, the Russians are like us. Look, whatever you hear, keep your mouth shut. And don\\'t let them see that you understand us. I\\'ll show you how everything works. In the bedroom, I cut, dry, and color, and here I wash their hair. If the client is tall, lift this up. If she\\'s small, put it down. This towel is to keep you from slipping. And I keep this here because up above it\\'s very uncomfortable, and if it\\'s down there, I have to bend down so often I wreck my back. I get a lot of backaches, too. And the shampoo is measured out. Sit down. - Are you all right? - Yes. Just one towel or the client will feel suffocated. I\\'m the same. And then, with that same towel, you dry her hair a bit so it doesn\\'t drip down her back. It\\'s all so well organized. You\\'re very smart, love. Hello. She doesn\\'t speak Spanish, she\\'s Russian. They\\'re in a terrible state. I took her in out of charity. When I saw her begging in the street, she reminded me of my mother. Don\\'t trust all the old women you see. Especially Russians. There are lots of mafias. People take advantage of you. Are you getting streaks? Sit down here. Wash hair, yes. She was a hairdresser in Russia. How do you communicate? With signs. She understands everything. She\\'s sharp. She\\'ll speak Spanish in no time. Yes, look at all the top models who are Russian. Heavens! - So, Russian? - Russia. The water, not hot, not cold. Very good. Hello. Hey there. We have a day off tomorrow. Then we\\'ll have one, too. We need a break. And we finish up next week. We wanted to have the wrap party here. Great. Do you want a sit-down meal or a buffet? A buffet would be great. And we\\'d like to have the terrace just for us. That\\'s no problem. Don\\'t look at me like that, you make me nervous. Same here. Go and have a drink, I\\'m working. All right. She\\'s been strange since she came back from the village. If she asks you about Paco, you know nothing. And it\\'s true. The less you know the better. And above all don\\'t keep thinking about it. Hello. - Are you with someone? - No. - I\\'m going to the bathroom. - What for? I\\'m dying to piss. It\\'s broken. I\\'m waiting for the plumber. I\\'ll throw some water down, for Christ\\'s sake! I have to piss. Hello! What\\'s wrong with you? - I\\'m at a difficult age. - You\\'re not the only one. - I\\'m going to trim your hair. - No, I know you. - Just the ends. - Less than a centimeter. Tell me, has your Dad not come back? No. He said goodbye for good. That\\'s incredible. I just don\\'t understand. It smells of farts! What\\'s your mother up to? What? She\\'s such a pain! Ever since she was a child. And in those days we didn\\'t have a bathroom. We did it in the yard. We\\'d be waiting for her all day. All day long she\\'d be in the yard, with the hens. Raimunda! This dressing gown... It\\'s Mom\\'s. I know that. And the smell? What smell? In the bathroom and here. It\\'s as if Mom had just been here, farting her ass off! Don\\'t you smell it? The way she used to fart! And she could never hide it because she was the first to laugh! It\\'s as if I can hear her now. Don\\'t be silly! Why did you bring these clothes? No wonder you have nightmares. You give away dead people\\'s clothes. Aunt Paula\\'s suitcase! The antique dolls! Her jewel case! What were you going to do with this? Nothing. You were going to keep it. Really, Sole. Don\\'t get the wrong idea. I didn\\'t bring the case. Then why is it here? When I got to Aunt Paula\\'s house... What? I\\'d never have believed this. Stealing the few things she had before she was even in the grave. What a nerve! Don\\'t go off like that! We have to buy another fridge. Why not fix the one in the storeroom? It doesn\\'t work. The motor\\'s making a noise. I said no one is to go in there, including you. The door was open, I went in for a hammer. Has anyone else been in? I don\\'t think so. You said you\\'d got rid of him. I wasn\\'t able to. You think I like having him in there? Get dressed, everyone will be arriving soon. Why are you still like that? - I\\'m not in a party mood. - Neither am l, but it\\'s work. Don\\'t be such a lazybones. Come on, pet, I\\'ll help you. What\\'s wrong? I can\\'t forget about it when he\\'s so near, in the storeroom. That\\'s the best way to go crazy, and to drive me crazy, too. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like to have killed your father. Paco wasn\\'t your father. Don\\'t lie to me anymore. I know you\\'re doing it for me, but, please, don\\'t lie. I\\'m not lying. He recognized you as his daughter, but he knew he wasn\\'t your biological father. So was he telling me the truth? Yes. But that doesn\\'t justify what he did. I promise I\\'ll tell you everything another time. What\\'s the point of sitting here? Who was my father? A guy in the village. Do I know him? He\\'s dead. I\\'ll tell you everything. I swear. I\\'ll hold you to your word. - Two mojitos! - Coming up! What about you, love? Another two? With lemon. It\\'s perfect. We need more glasses. I can hardly keep up. Isn\\'t Paula looking pretty? Here. Thanks. How delicious! I can\\'t take any more. They\\'re really good. With your cleavage and my mojitos, we\\'d make a fortune. We should start working nights and try to liven up this lousy neighborhood. We\\'ll talk about that. First, we have to keep this lot happy. Have a mojito! Keep down, they mustn\\'t see you! I\\'d like to see Raimunda and Paula. The other day, I only saw their feet. And look at the fuss you caused! Is that the restaurant? She said it was going well, but I never imagined this! She deserves it. She\\'s had a hard time. Stay in the car and don\\'t let anyone see you. No one can see me here! What are you doing here? This is great! I\\'ve brought you Aunt Paula\\'s things. I didn\\'t know about the party. It\\'s a film crew celebrating the end of the shoot. I\\'ve been catering for them. Let\\'s put the suitcase away. Why did you bother? I\\'d never have kept anything of Auntie\\'s, much less hidden it from you. I know that. I\\'m sorry for what I said. I always shoot my mouth off. Hello, Auntie. - You want anything? - No. <i>I can see the twinkling</i> <i>of the lights in the distance</i> <i>That are marking my return</i> Remember? How could I forget? It\\'s so long since I heard you sing! I\\'ve never heard her sing. Really? Really, never. - Would you like to? - What do you think? Of course! Come on! I can\\'t believe it. Sit there. Be quiet! Sit down! This woman\\'s going to sing! Good evening. I\\'d like to thank the crew for the work you\\'ve given us these past weeks. Thank you so much. I haven\\'t sung for a very long time, but I\\'ll do it tonight, and see how it goes. <i>I\\'m afraid of the encounter</i> <i>With the past that\\'s coming back</i> <i>To confront my life</i> Your grandma taught her that song for the casting for child singers. <i>I\\'m afraid of the nights</i> <i>That, filled with memories, </i> <i>Enchain my dreams</i> <i>But the fleeing traveler</i> <i>Sooner or later</i> <i>must come to a halt</i> <i>And even though oblivion, </i> <i>which destroys everything, </i> <i>Has killed my old illusions</i> <i>I still retain a humble hope</i> <i>hidden away</i> <i>And that is all</i> <i>of my heart\\'s fortune</i> <i>Coming back</i> <i>With a wrinkled forehead</i> <i>And the snows of time</i> <i>Silvering my brow</i> <i>Feeling</i> <i>That life is an instant</i> <i>That twenty years is nothing</i> <i>That the feverish eyes</i> <i>Wandering in the shadows</i> <i>seek you and name you</i> <i>Living</i> <i>With my soul clinging</i> <i>To a sweet memory</i> <i>That I weep for again</i> <i>Autos Amigos. </i> Good morning. I\\'m calling because I saw your ad. I need to rent a van. <i>What kind, and for how long? </i> The cheapest one you have. It\\'s just for one day. Yes? <i>Could I speak to Miss Raimunda? </i> Speaking. <i>Emilio gave me your number</i> <i>so you could show me the restaurant. </i> <i>I\\'m very keen to see it. </i> <i>My name is Carlos. </i> Well, you should have called earlier because a neighbor has taken it over. <i>Emilio didn\\'t tell me that. </i> That\\'s his strategy, just in case. <i>Could I speak to the person</i> <i>who\\'s taken it over? </i> This is her day off, I\\'m sorry. If you call Emilio I\\'m sure he\\'ll explain everything. <i>Thank you. </i> Goodbye. <i>- Hello? </i> - Emilio? It\\'s Raimunda. <i>It\\'s great to hear you. </i> <i>Did a man go to see the restaurant? </i> Yes, but I didn\\'t trust him. I think he wanted it as a front. <i>For what? </i> For drugs, or to open a brothel. I don\\'t know. When I said it wasn\\'t doing well he said that was even better, so... <i>Why on earth did you say that? </i> I\\'ve been meaning to call you for days. I hope you understand. I know it\\'s not the way to do things, but I\\'ve taken over the restaurant. <i>You? </i> <i>What do you mean? </i> I can explain it all to you. <i>You were out of line, </i> <i>way out of line. </i> <i>You abused my trust. </i> It\\'s no excuse, but when the film crew appeared, I was desperate. And now that Paco\\'s left us, you can imagine... <i>What? Paco\\'s left you? </i> Yes. We had a huge fight. He\\'s gone, and I don\\'t think he\\'ll be back. He left the same day you went to Barcelona. <i>How are you coping? </i> Me? I\\'m hysterical. Clutching at straws. <i>Well, we\\'ll try to sort it out. </i> Tell me what I owe for the month, and I\\'ll send it to you, but give me a few days. - Hello? - <i>Raimunda? </i> Yes, who\\'s that? <i>It\\'s Agustina. I\\'m in Madrid, </i> <i>and I\\'d like to see you. </i> It\\'s difficult, I\\'m really busy today. <i>Tomorrow? </i> No, the whole week is a real mess. <i>Don\\'t say that. </i> <i>I\\'m in the hospital. </i> What\\'s wrong? <i>I\\'ve got cancer. </i> <i>The doctors told me yesterday. </i> <i>I need to see you. </i> Tell me what hospital you\\'re in, I\\'ll come today. <i>I\\'m in Central Hospital. </i> <i>God bless you. </i> You go up, I\\'m in a hurry. Give this to your aunt. - Hello, Auntie. - What are you doing here? Is that your mother shouting? Come to the window! What? I\\'m leaving Paula with you. But I\\'m working. I have to go to the hospital to see Agustina. She\\'s got cancer. What a pity, the poor thing. Paula is bringing up Auntie\\'s case. Keep it. I\\'ve got to do a few things, and then I\\'ll come back. Give my regards to Agustina. - Tell her you saw me! - Yes, nuisance. Can I come in now? Yes, love. How are you? They opened then closed me up again. - I knew I had something nasty. - Don\\'t give up hope. The flowers are lovely! You shouldn\\'t have bothered. Leave them there. I have to ask you a favor. Whatever you want. Close the door. Get a chair. I won\\'t last very long, but I don\\'t want to die without knowing what happened to my mother. But what can I do? You can tell me if she\\'s alive or dead. How will I know? Ask your mother. My mother? She\\'s dead! But she appeared to your Aunt Paula and looked after her until she died. The whole village knows that. If she should appear to you, ask her about my mother. That\\'s all I\\'m asking. What you\\'re asking me is crazy. Did you ever see her with your own eyes? No. And you live across the street. I think she hid from me. But I heard your aunt talking to her a thousand times. If I hear anything, I\\'ll tell you. But I think it\\'s unlikely. You owe me this. It\\'s all I\\'m asking. I have to go, I\\'ve got lots to do. Wait, my sister wants to see you. She\\'ll be here any minute. Some other day, I\\'m in a real hurry. She wants you to go on TV. You know she works on <i>Wherever You Are. </i> They want to surprise her, and they thought of you. You were friends as children, and you both went to an audition. That\\'s enough for several shows, with interviews, music and songs from yesterday, from today and for all times. Tell her I don\\'t like television. Neither do I. I\\'ll tell her, but don\\'t forget what I said. I won\\'t. The Russian loves TV. I don\\'t know if she understands, but she\\'s hypnotized. There\\'s something about trash TV. Once I start watching it, I can\\'t stop. I feel worse and worse, but I\\'m hooked. It\\'s like a drug. I had to stop watching it at night. I couldn\\'t sleep afterwards. All that shouting drives you crazy. Do you like dolls? I like these, they look like they\\'re from a horror movie. They\\'re very ancient. Your mom played with them when she was pregnant with you. Why didn\\'t mom live with you? We were very short on money. Your granddad went to work in Venezuela, I kept Sole, and your mother went to live with Aunt Paula. What has she told you? Nothing, she doesn\\'t like talking about that time. Do you get along well? It\\'s better now, but at times she\\'s really stroppy, Grandma. She\\'s got a temper. How did you get along with her? When she was little, she was the apple of my eye, but as a teenager, for some reason I didn\\'t know, she grew away from me until I lost her completely. Your mother didn\\'t love me. It really hurts when a daughter doesn\\'t love her mother. That\\'s why, now that it\\'s just the two of you, you have to love her very much, and she has to feel that. Why have you come back? Because I was very lonely. Good afternoon. Hello. I need eight meters of plastic clothes line and some packing tape. How much tape? Four or five rolls. Very well. Five rolls. One... Two... And a pick and a shovel. Very well. - Great! - Bye! How are you, Raimunda? Fed up. How\\'s Agustina? Mad as a hatter. Hi, Mom! - What\\'s up with you? - Nothing. Fetch me a glass of water, love. Do you mind if she stays here tonight? No, but where will she sleep? In the spare room. Paco\\'s coming over tonight. He wants to talk. I\\'d like us to be alone. All right. You\\'re sleeping here tonight. I\\'m off. I\\'ve got a long night ahead of me. Hello. I need a favor tonight. Tonight? Can\\'t it wait until tomorrow? No, but I\\'ll pay you, like any client. No, love, for you a discount, but I didn\\'t know you liked pussy. I don\\'t. So if you don\\'t want to go muff-diving, what do you want? I\\'ll explain on the way. First, we have to put the freezer in the van... - What? - And take it to a dung heap. We can\\'t carry that on our own! We\\'ll ask the neighbors to help us. Put on something comfortable. You look like you\\'re going to explode in that. - Wait! Wait! - Like this! It sticks out here. Get it on the sidewalk. - It\\'s slipping! - No, it\\'s not. Get it parallel to that. Now, up! One, two, three! Come on! One, two, three! Push! It\\'s in. Bloody hell. Did you hurt yourself? Who needs a spleen, anyway? Where are we going? To the Jucar River. Where\\'s that? 180 kilometers away. 180 kilometers! It\\'ll take us all night just to go and come back. I said I\\'d pay by the hour. Just to go with you? To come with me to the river, dig a hole, bury the freezer, and not ask questions. Look, I appreciate your trust, but my life\\'s complicated enough! I have no job, no papers, I have to work the streets to survive. Christ, you could have asked me! I\\'m asking you now. How much? You should\\'ve asked first. All right, give me the nights. What nights? The drinks at night, for a month. And I keep what I make from my cocktails. And you buy the bottles. All right, partner, but not a word about this. What can I do? I\\'m your accomplice now. Just so you know, I haven\\'t killed anyone. Don\\'t tell me anything. I wasn\\'t going to. Get out of the way. Give me that. Oh, my God! I can\\'t do any more, I\\'m dead. Take a break, I\\'ll fill this in. What are you doing here? - Can we talk? - I\\'m really busy. Come in. - How are you? - The same. - Have you found out anything? - About what? About what I asked you. I didn\\'t think you were serious. May I sit down? Have pity on me. I do, all the pity you want, but don\\'t ask crazy things. All I want is to know if she\\'s alive or dead! I understand that with the wind and the cancer you\\'ve lost your mind, but you can\\'t complicate other people\\'s lives. We\\'ve got enough on our plates. The day your parents died in the fire, my mother disappeared. Don\\'t you think that\\'s a strange coincidence? No, it\\'s just a coincidence. You said your mother left in the morning and it wasn\\'t the first time she disappeared. Your grandmother had to raise you because she was never at home! Don\\'t make me say more. My mother went off that morning, but it was to join your father in the hut. That\\'s a lie. - No one saw her. - Of course not. She made sure of that. My mother was having an affair with your father. What are you saying! My mother would never have allowed it! That\\'s why she went to live with your Aunt Paula. She did that because my aunt wasn\\'t well, but she never left him. She went between the two houses. You don\\'t know, you weren\\'t there, and you hardly had any contact with your mother for years. I often heard her complain you treated her like shit. Those were her words! I\\'ve heard a lot of things. Once I heard a row between your mother and mine. Your mother told her she could have your father, she didn\\'t care. And she didn\\'t envy her because he\\'d been born to hurt the women who loved him. What are you getting at? That your parents\\' death and my mother\\'s disappearance are connected. Then why haven\\'t you gone to the police? They ask a lot of questions, and we should wash our dirty linen at home. That\\'s why I won\\'t go on TV even though my sister is insisting. You and I have to sort this out. I have to get back to work. Think about what I said. How\\'s Paco? What? He\\'s fine. Shouldn\\'t we call Auntie to say we\\'re coming? She never goes out. We should warn her. Why? It\\'s not polite just to turn up at someone\\'s house, even if she is your sister. What\\'s up with you and Sole now? It\\'s a question of manners. You and your aunt are getting on my fucking nerves! You\\'re so vulgar. What have you brought, Raimunda? Food for the three of us. Why did you bother? Why are you shouting? Are you going deaf? - Yes, I\\'m deaf. - Deaf as a post. We\\'re staying a while, I want you to cut my hair. Why didn\\'t you call? I\\'ve got a client. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m in no hurry. And we have to talk. - About what? - Aunt Paula\\'s house. - May I go and watch TV? - Yes, go on. We have to sort out all the paperwork. Grandma! I\\'m here. Don\\'t make a sound, my mother\\'s here. I heard her. Where\\'s the Russian? - Who\\'s the Russian? - A woman who\\'s helping me. I was telling her about my son being expelled again. He slashed the tires of the priest who teaches him religion. I was telling her, and she left me talking to myself with my hair half-washed. She must have gone out. I don\\'t know, but she went off like a shot. I\\'ll finish you off. She\\'s got claustrophobia, and at times she needs to go outside. Some help she is. Do you pay her? No, I took her in. She eats and sleeps here. I gave her Mom\\'s clothes. I don\\'t like you taking in people you don\\'t know. We told her that. People take advantage of her. Look at the Russian. She\\'s living in luxury here. How was Paco the other night? Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes. I think he\\'s living with someone, but I couldn\\'t care less. Why didn\\'t you tell me you had a Russian? I guess I forgot. That\\'s Agustina! Good afternoon, Agustina. Good afternoon. We know from your sister that your mother was a single parent. My mother was a hippie. That\\'s Agustina! <i>She never married. </i> <i>So she practiced free love. </i> <i>Your mother had a friend</i> <i>who died the same day</i> <i>she disappeared. </i> <i>Yes. </i> <i>How did she die? </i> <i>In a fire. </i> <i>There are lots of fires</i> <i>in my village, </i> <i>because of the East wind. </i> <i>Agustina\\'s village is the wonderful</i> <i>Alcanfor de las Infantas, </i> <i>which, according to statistics, </i> <i>has the highest rate</i> <i>of insanity per inhabitant. </i> <i>Do you think that perhaps</i> <i>your mother was mentally unbalanced? </i> <i>No, when my mother wasn\\'t well, </i> <i>as she was a hippie, </i> <i>she\\'d leave the village. </i> <i>Until one day she left</i> <i>and never came back. </i> <i>Yes, that was</i> <i>almost four years ago. </i> <i>And that friend? </i> <i>We\\'re very interested</i> <i>in that friend who died</i> <i>the same day your mother</i> <i>disappeared. Tell us about that. </i> <i>About what? </i> <i>We\\'d like you to tell us about</i> <i>the woman who died in the fire. </i> <i>- You know there are rumors... </i> <i>- I don\\'t believe in rumors. </i> <i>I\\'d like you to explain</i> <i>what you told our producer. </i> <i>It was something important</i> <i>about that woman and her husband</i> <i>that linked them</i> <i>to your mother\\'s disappearance. </i> <i>Is that true? </i> <i>I\\'d rather... </i> <i>not talk about that. </i> <i>Those were suppositions of mine. </i> <i>But you\\'re here to talk about</i> <i>that woman and your mother. </i> <i>I\\'ve changed my mind. </i> SHE CAN\\'T BELIEVE HER SISTER <i>What\\'s wrong? You look</i> <i>uncomfortable, a bit nervous. </i> I\\'d like to explain that Agustina is also here to tell us that she\\'s got a terminal illness. Isn\\'t that so? Agustina has got cancer. You\\'ve got cancer. But don\\'t be nervous, you\\'re among friends. A big hand for Agustina! Agustina has got a special wish. To go to a clinic in Houston. But to go to Houston, you have to speak out. Remember, you made a commitment to this channel. Agustina came to see me. She did? She insists that Mom appears to us. She wants me to ask her about her mother. She also said that when she disappeared, her mother was having an affair with Dad. Do you know anything about that? No. Well, Mom told me, after... After what? After... she found out. Look at me. Are there things I should know and don\\'t? Oodles. But if I tell you, you\\'ll be annoyed or you won\\'t believe me. I promise I\\'ll believe you and I won\\'t be annoyed. Mom\\'s been appearing all the time. To whom? Sit down. She was with Aunt Paula until she died. It was she who called Agustina and opened the door so she could find the body. She put out the money so they\\'d bring her bread and left everything paid for the funeral. Did you do all that? Yeah. Did Agustina tell you all that? You don\\'t believe me. Agustina is crazy! Last time we saw Auntie you said yourself it was incredible that she could live like that, with her mind gone and half blind. Remember? Yes, I do, but what are you saying? That she wasn\\'t alone. Who do you think made the wafers and put them in tupperwares, one for each of us? Who do you think took the dolls and Auntie\\'s valuables before the neighbors swiped everything? Now do you understand? Have you seen her? Yes. Is she, by any chance, the Russian? Yes. Where is she? In there. Mom! What are you doing down there? Weren\\'t you dead? I\\'ve come back to ask you to forgive me. I knew nothing about it. I never even imagined it. Come on, Paula! My little girl! The worst is over. She\\'s seen me, and she didn\\'t reject me, did she? No. Did you really come back to ask her to forgive you? And also to be with you. Someday you can explain it all to me. Yes, and that day I hope you understand me and that you forgive me, too. I have to talk to her. Why don\\'t we go back? Now? Sure. - I\\'ve dreamt about this so often. - So have I. I don\\'t know where to begin. You\\'re not a ghost, are you? You\\'re not dead. No, love, I\\'m not. That\\'s such a relief. But even if I had died, I\\'d have come back to ask you to forgive me for not seeing what was going on. I was blind. I found out the day of the fire. Had you really left Dad? Yes. I couldn\\'t stand his cheating. The afternoon of the fire you rang and spoke to Auntie. As usual, you didn\\'t ask for me. I got angry and told your aunt you were heartless. As I kept badmouthing you, your aunt defended you and told me everything. That your father had abused you, that you\\'d gotten pregnant, and that Paula is your daughter and your sister. I couldn\\'t believe it. How could such a monstrous thing happen in front of me without me realizing it? Then, I understood everything. I understood your silence and why you grew so distant. I understood why your father went to Venezuela. He couldn\\'t cope with the shame of what he\\'d done. I understood why, after marrying Paco, you went to Madrid and wanted nothing to do with us. I hated you for not noticing anything. And you were right, love. When I found out, I was like a wild thing. I went to the hut, ready to scratch his eyes out! I found him asleep with Agustina\\'s mother, both of them worn out. They didn\\'t see me. I set fire to the hut. It was a windy day and in no time the flames had devoured everything. They didn\\'t have time to wake up. The ashes in your grave are those of Agustina\\'s mother? Yes. Afterwards, I wandered the countryside for a few days, hiding, like an animal. I was going to give myself up, but first I went to Paula\\'s house to see her. She was in a terrible state. When she saw me, she wasn\\'t at all surprised. I came from the past, where she was living. She greeted me as if I had just gone out the door. With the tragedy, she lost what little reason she had. I couldn\\'t leave her on her own, so I stayed and looked after her until she died. In the village they think you\\'re a ghost. That\\'s the good thing about such superstitious places. It was easier for me to go along with them than to speak the truth. I thought I\\'d be arrested. I never imagined that no one would investigate or punish me, although all this time I swear I\\'ve been in a living purgatory. Never better said. It\\'s too early to go to the village. We shouldn\\'t arrive in daylight. Why don\\'t we drive by the river? It\\'s been so long since I saw it. It\\'s not what it was. It\\'s dry. How do you know? Because there\\'s a drought all over Spain. Don\\'t you know? We used to come here for picnics. Remember, Raimunda? Yes. There was more water then. I told you it was dry. Shall we eat something? Not for me. - I\\'m going to eat a wafer. - Me too. This was your father\\'s favorite place. Paco\\'s? Yes. It was the only thing he missed. This river. I\\'m glad he\\'s resting here. Come on! Nobody\\'ll see you now! If Paula were alive and could see us now, all together... she\\'d be so happy. Have you always had such a big chest? Yes, since I was little. I remembered you having less. Have you had anything done? No! What a thing to say! All right. Grandma, did you ride the bike? Yes, half an hour every day. It\\'s good for blood pressure and the heart. What did Aunt Paula say? She roared laughing. Bye. It\\'s Aunt Paula... Don\\'t start. I\\'ll get it. Hide Mom\\'s plate and cutlery. - Who is it? - Agustina. We\\'re having supper. We\\'ve just arrived. I\\'m sorry to bother you. Don\\'t stay out there. Thank you. Good evening. - Sit down. - Thank you. I came to apologize about the show. You shouldn\\'t have done it. It wasn\\'t right. I know that. It\\'s no excuse, but they offered to take me to Houston. They cure everything there. But I couldn\\'t do it. I\\'d rather die alone in my house, but at peace, and able to look you in the eye. - Mom, I\\'m going to bed, all right? - Yes, go on. - Will you have some supper? - No, thanks. I heard you\\'re going to sell the house. We\\'d thought about it, but now we\\'re here... There are so many memories. Well, I have to go. Why don\\'t you stay a while? I have to go to the nurse to get my injection. In Madrid they told me to learn to do it myself, but it gives me the creeps! Your sister is unforgivable. Leaving you alone like this. Don\\'t even mention her. As I didn\\'t say what they wanted on television she\\'s not speaking to me. She\\'s very angry with me. But I\\'m even angrier with her. With good reason. I envy you two. You\\'re so close. Irene! I\\'ve longed to see you. Here I am. I heard about your problem, and I can imagine how lonely you are. Very lonely. If only Paula were here... I\\'m here to look after you. You left the door open. Don\\'t worry, I closed it. Did you go to the nurse? No, I\\'m very tired. Tomorrow. Tomorrow you\\'ll be in a lot of pain. Have you got the medicine and the needles? Yes, I bought it all in Madrid. Good, I\\'ll give you the injection. I was born in this bed. My mother slept here. And in this bed we held your sister Paula\\'s wake. I know, and I\\'m so grateful. We have to talk, Irene. About everything you want. But don\\'t tell anyone I\\'ve come back. Don\\'t worry. Thank you for not talking about me on television. It\\'s our own business. That\\'s right, and no one else\\'s. Mom, it\\'s me, let me in! What are you doing here? Come in! I missed you. - Are you going to stay here? - Yes, until the end. Agustina is very ill. After what I did to her mother, the least I can do is look after her until she dies. I have so much to tell you. I haven\\'t told you about Paco or what I\\'ve done.
